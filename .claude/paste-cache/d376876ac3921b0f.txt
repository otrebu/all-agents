# Drift Analysis: Stories vs Implementation

  ## Scope
  Analyze drift ONLY for stories currently being worked on.
  Drift = implementation diverges from story spec, NOT "roadmap features not yet built".

  ## Input Files
  Read these story files:
  - docs/planning/stories/001-cost-dashboard-overview.md
  - docs/planning/stories/002-cdr-drill-down.md
  - docs/planning/stories/003-import-dashboard.md

  ## Process
  For EACH story:
  1. Extract acceptance criteria / requirements from the story
  2. Find the corresponding implementation (routes, APIs, components)
  3. Compare: does implementation match story spec?

  ## What IS drift:
  - Story says "show total costs from CDRs + Charges" → implementation only sums CDRs
  - Story says "Company dropdown" → no Company concept exists
  - Story says "sort by X column" → sorting doesn't work
  - Feature partially works vs story spec

  ## What is NOT drift:
  - Features from OTHER stories not yet implemented
  - Roadmap tasks not related to these 3 stories
  - Future MVP scope items

  ## Output
  Write to: docs/planning/drift-from-stories.md
