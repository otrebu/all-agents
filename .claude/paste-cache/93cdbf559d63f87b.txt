is there a nvim plugin to search for and auto complete when typing @ to find files?

Surveyed completion frameworks and contemplated plugin accuracy verification.




I'll search for current information on this specific feature.

Pivoted search toward specialized plugins for mention-based file completion.

Based on my research, there isn't a single widely-adopted plugin that does exactly what you're describing (typing @ to trigger a fuzzy file finder inline), but you have several options to achieve this:

Options
1. nvim-cmp + cmp-path with custom trigger

You can configure cmp-path to use @ as a path alias:

lua
{ name = 'path', option = {
  pathMappings = {
    ['@'] = '${folder}/src',  -- maps @ to your src directory
  },
}}
This gives you path completion when typing @/ but it's not a fuzzy finder.

2. Custom nvim-cmp source with trigger character

You could write a custom source that triggers on @ and uses Telescope/fzf under the hood. nvim-cmp supports trigger_characters per source.

3. Keymap-based approach (most practical)

Map @ in insert mode to trigger Telescope's find_files and insert the result:

lua
vim.keymap.set('i', '@', function()
  require('telescope.builtin').find_files({
    attach_mappings = function(_, map)
      map('i', '<CR>', function(prompt_bufnr)
        local selection = require('telescope.actions.state').get_selected_entry()
        require('telescope.actions').close(prompt_bufnr)
        vim.api.nvim_put({ selection.value }, '', true, true)
      end)
      return true
    end
  })
end)
4. blink.cmp - Similar configurability to nvim-cmp, could be extended similarly.

Alternative View
The "@" mention pattern (à la Cursor/GitHub) is fundamentally different from completion - it's more of a "picker insertion" pattern. In Neovim, the idiomatic approach is typically:

Use a keybinding (like <C-p>) to open Telescope
Select and insert
If you're specifically wanting the Cursor-style @file reference for AI contexts, that's typically baked into AI-specific plugins like avante.nvim or codecompanion.nvim rather than general completion plugins.

Want me to dig deeper into any of these approaches?
