⏺ Good choice - demo 6a shows "I can login and manage my profile", demo 6b shows "admins can manage everyone".

  Final 8 milestones:

  1. Company + Import + Dashboard
  2. 5-layer structure + Bulk edit (incl. subscriber names)
  3. Reports + Drill-down
  4. Report scheduling + email
  5. Auth (BetterAuth temp)
  6. Authz + RBAC + Profiles
  7. User management (Company Admin + JT Admin) + Granular permissions
  8. Invoice PDF access [TBD]

  Ready to draft ROADMAP.md?

❯ have you not written anything to files yet? I thought your roadmap planning prompt included that, did it
  not?

∴ Thinking…

  The user is right - the skill instructions said to save incrementally! Let me re-read:

  "IMPORTANT - Incremental Saving: Do NOT wait until the end to create the document. Save progress incrementally:
  - After each milestone is well-defined, offer to write it to ROADMAP.md
  - Update the document progressively during the conversation
  - This protects against crashes/disconnects and keeps context fresh"

  I should have been writing to ROADMAP.md progressively as we defined milestones. My mistake! Let me write the
  roadmap now with all 8 milestones we've defined.

⏺ You're right - I should have been saving incrementally. My bad! 🤦

  Let me write what we have now.
