So I wonder if we could write this file as we progress in this conversation. Even if you make it clear at the top that this is a temporary file, I'm worried that we might lose some of the key insights we are getting here. Updating the vision with the multi-account support, I suggest you spin up as sub-agent to do that straight away, and another sub-agent to start to create the temporary roadmap with this initial discovery we've done together.

Also, I think the dashboard will be good, then report, then yeah, let's face it, this kind of needs to be built all of it to be the wow factor. I think just using the modern technologies compared to what we had makes lots of sense. So it's yeah, I wouldn't overword it's more about how can we have basically nice demos to stakeholders every week while we're building this application iteratively and bit by bit that's all really so, so yeah, dashboard could be among the first things we build, but obviously I think we need to be mindful of some of the foundation. Whether we definitely need which is the import which we can actually partially had done already, but ignore what's done so far. So we need to import XML files and we need them to import them in a certain company structure that we have not done yet. So we probably need something to set up a company in the first place and point them to some converse accounts that's not anywhere yet. So that's pretty important I would say. So that then by the time you import the files, then you have those files linked to that company and you can navigate properly, and therefore the dashboard is going to work. So that's really, really important.

Also, it's worth mentioning that we are doing this roadmap, we might not have every single requirement clear yet, so hopefully through this process, this comes out, otherwise, hopefully comes out during the story planning, which is the next step.
