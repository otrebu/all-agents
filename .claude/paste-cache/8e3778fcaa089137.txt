  Looks right? Any tweaks before we continue refining Milestone 3 priorities?

❯ I think we are being too superficial here, is your roadmap prompt too vague? or not supportive enough about
  going into details?

∴ Thinking…

  The user is right - we're staying too high-level. Let me read the roadmap-interactive prompt to see what it
  actually says and whether it's guiding me to go deeper.

⏺ Fair challenge. Let me check the prompt.

⏺ Read(/Users/Uberto.Rapizzi/dev/all-agents/.claude/skills/ralph-plan/context/workflows/ralph/planning/roadmap-inte
      ractive.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

∴ Thinking…

  File doesn't exist at that path. Let me search for it - it was referenced in the skill definition.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/roadmap-interactive.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file
     /Users/Uberto.Rapizzi/dev/BillingManager/context/workflows/ralph/planning/roadmap-interactive.md

∴ Thinking…

  Found it in the BillingManager repo, not all-agents. Let me read it.

⏺ Read(/Users/Uberto.Rapizzi/dev/BillingManager/context/workflows/ralph/planning/roadmap-interactive.md)

∴ Thinking…

  Ah, the prompt is actually quite detailed! It has:

  1. Phases: Scope → Priority → Tradeoff → Dependency → Milestone Definition
  2. Probing questions for each phase
  3. A proper ROADMAP.md format with:
    - Outcome for each milestone
    - Why this first
    - Key deliverables
    - Success criteria
    - Dependencies
  4. Validation checklist to verify against VISION.md

  I've been too shallow - I skipped phases 2 and 3 (priority/tradeoff), and my roadmap format is way simpler than
  what the prompt specifies.

  The user is right - I should be going deeper. Let me acknowledge this and either:
  1. Suggest we redo with proper depth
  2. Or go back and fill in the missing details

  I should also update the roadmap to match the proper format.

⏺ You're right. The prompt is actually detailed - I skipped phases and used a shallow format.

  What I missed:
  - Phase 2: Priority exploration ("what would you cut?")
  - Phase 3: Tradeoff exploration ("what risks are acceptable?")
  - Proper ROADMAP.md format with: Outcome, Why first, Key deliverables, Success criteria, Dependencies

  Current roadmap is just bullet lists. Should be:
  - What users can DO when milestone completes
  - Measurable success criteria
  - Links to milestone folders

  Your call:
  1. Redo properly - go through remaining phases, then rewrite roadmap in full format
  2. Fill gaps now - flesh out what we have with success criteria and outcomes

  Which approach?
