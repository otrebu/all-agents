So I don't know, I guess on one side I feel if we spend the time now to build the foundational layer with the role and the custom structure, we risk taking a little while to demo something useful or not useful but impressive, especially for the role-based stuff. I guess which I think can we not add that later? The whole authentication system I feel it'd be uneasy because I don't want to try to plug into a third-party yet. So yeah, just maybe consider that.
One big mistake on that is like invoice access. I mean, the access is downloading the PDF, and we have the invoice data, so I don't know why you put that into the nice-to-have. Yes, users can see reports before structure exists. Of course, because the customization of the structure is an extra, but there is consideration to be done about the improvement from the old building manager to the new one.
That is:
1. One company can actually have multiple accounts (converse accounts) which means multiple bills for the same time period, which is something new.
So perhaps we should also go back and add that to the vision because that didn't come out earlier, and that's very important to know to you.
For the rot map (drill-down), it's just you're drilling down a report. So obviously we need to build reports to be able to drill down, right? And yes, I think auth is not really that foundational. What could be a nice extra is to maybe use a different auth server for fun, using better auth, so that I don't have to do any work against B2C yet and switch to that later on. That's something to bear in mind, especially if you think that's a good idea. But I think it's definitely not foundational just yet.
