⏺ I've read your VISION.md - comprehensive doc covering the CTI replacement for JT's billing platform. MVP
  targeting March 2026.

  ---
  Let's work on your product roadmap. I've read your vision document and understand you're building a billing data
  visualization platform to replace CTI.

  To start: What's the most important thing users should be able to do in your first release?

  Looking at the vision, I see dashboard, core reports, drill-down, custom structures, invoice access, scheduling,
  auth, and bulk edit all listed as MVP. That's a lot. What's the absolute minimum a customer needs to consider
  this usable on day one?

  (You can say 'done' at any point when you feel we've covered enough.)

∴ Thinking…

  The user is asking if I read the roadmap-interactive.md file that's referenced in the skill instructions. I
  should check - I didn't actually read it. Let me read it now to follow the proper workflow.

⏺ No, I didn't! Let me read it now.
