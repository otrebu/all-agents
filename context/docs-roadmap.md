# Docs Roadmap

## Restructure docs into atomic docs

- [ ] Get rid of blocks/patterns and move them to foundations/
- [ ] Create a new command to generate atomic docs from a given prompt.

## logging-cli

- [ ] Add log to file documentation, when to use, when not to use and how to do it.

## unit-testing

- [ ] More documention on unit testing patterns, for example mocking and when and how

## code-standards

- check TODOS comments those are important
- [ ] Loading configuration / environment variables, 12factor app about config, tools to use. They all need to be documented! `@context/foundations/env-variables.md` should be a foundation or a pattern??

### coding-style

It is being rewritten on claude.ai
