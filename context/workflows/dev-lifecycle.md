# Development Workflow

## Definition of Done ✓

A feature/change is complete when ALL of these are done:

- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] README, CLAUDE.md and relevant docs updated
- [ ] Committed with conventional commit message
- [ ] On feature branch (when appropriate)

---

## 0) Get context

- Read @README.md and package.json first
- Ask concise questions if missing info (test command, branch naming, CI)

## 1) Planning 📋

**Before starting:**

- Use plan mode to plan
- Write to `docs/planning/stories/*` or `docs/planning/tasks/*` when plan is approved
- Follow @context/primitives/patterns/task-template.md and @context/primitives/patterns/story-template.md for templates
- Research external knowledge if needed with @parallel-search or @gh-search
- Think MVP - don't over-plan
- **Ask for review before proceeding**

**While implementing:**

- Update plan as you work
- Append detailed change descriptions (for handover)

## 2) Tests 🧪

- Add or update tests for every new feature
- Update tests to reflect new behavior (don't force green)
- Keep tests fast; mark slow tests as integration/e2e and isolate from unit runs
- Use TDD when appropriate

## 3) Commit discipline ✍️

**ATOMIC COMMITS:** One logical change that can be reverted independently

- Commit frequently (after each logical unit)
- Group by scope (auth, payment), NOT type (deps, code, tests)
- ❗ AI SHALL NEVER sign commits
- Run tests before commit

**Read & follow:** `@context/workflows/commit.md`

## 4) Branching 🔀

**Start new feature:**
Read & follow: `@context/workflows/start-feature.md`

**Complete feature:**
Read & follow: `@context/workflows/complete-feature.md`

## 5) Documentation 📝

Update docs immediately after implementing features:

- **README**: Add features/commands, update examples, refresh structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update technical details, how to develop on the project
- **Relevant docs**: Update `/context` if it is central global knowledge or `/docs` if it is project specific knowledge
- **Commit with feature** or in immediate follow-up
- **For AI**: Don't wait to be asked. Ask "What docs need updating?" and do it

## 6) Pre-merge checklist ✅

- Tests pass locally and in CI
- Lint/type checks pass
- Docs updated (README/examples)
- PR description explains what/why, links ticket, notes breaking changes

## 7) Tools/ CLI Development

If pre-commit hooks are installed they will run automatically for quality checks like:

- `run lint:fix`
- `run format:check`
- `run typecheck`

If Tests are NOT in hooks (judgment call based on change scope), and `run test` for big changes.
