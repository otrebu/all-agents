I know there isn't really a standard SQL testing framework but at work, we currently run tests on queries through Pytest against databases set up in containers.\n\nI'm more interested in the way you typically set up your mocks and structure your tests. I typically set up a mock for each table interrogated by my queries. Each table is populated with all combinations of data that will test different parts of the query.\n\nFor every query tested, the database is therefore set up the exact same way. For every test, the query results would therefore also be identical. I just set up different test functions that assert on the different conditions of the result that we're interested in.\n\nMy team seems to have different approach though. It's not entirely consistent across the org but the pattern more closely resembles every test having their own specific set of mocks. Sometimes mocks are shared, but the data is mutated to fit the test case before populating the DB.\n\nI'm not super experienced with SQL and the best practices around it. Though I'm mostly just trying to leverage Pytest fixtures to keep as much of the setup logic centralised in one place.\n\nWould appreciate everyone's input on the matter!

No files are created on disk. * **File-Based:** For more persistent analysis, you can first build a database file and then run multiple queries against it. ### Commands\n\n[]()\n\nThere are three main commands: `build` , `query` , and `shell` . #### `tq build`\n\n[]()\n\nBuilds a persistent SQLite database file from a Go package. This is the primary way to create a database for later analysis.\n```\n#  Build a database from the testdata package \n./bin/tq build --pkg ./testdata/ --output tq.db\n```\n\n#### `tq query`\n\n[]()\n\nExecutes a single, non-interactive query. ```\n#  Run an in-memory query against the testdata package \n./bin/tq query --pkg ./testdata/ \" SELECT * FROM failed_tests \" \n\n #  Run a query against a pre-built database file \n./bin/tq query --db tq.db \" SELECT * FROM failed_tests \"\n```\n\n#### `tq shell`\n\n[]()\n\nStarts an interactive SQL shell. ```\n#  Start an in-memory shell for the testdata package \n./bin/tq shell --pkg ./testdata/\n\n #  Start a shell using a pre-built database file \n./bin/tq shell --db tq.db\n```\n\n### Command-Line Help\n\n[]()\n\nYou can get more information about the available commands and flags by using the `--help` flag. ```\n% ./bin/tq --help\nTestQuery (tq) is a command-line tool that allows you to query Go test results using a SQL interface.\nIt is designed to help developers understand and analyze tests in their projects,\nespecially in large and mature codebases. Usage:\n  tq [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell\n  help        Help about any command \n  query       Execute a single query. shell       Start an interactive SQL shell. Flags:\n  -h, --help   help for tq\n\nUse \" tq [command] --help \" for more information about a command. ```\n\n### Makefile Targets\n\n[]()\n\nThe `Makefile` provides several targets to standardize the development and testing workflow:\n\n* `make build` : Compiles the `tq` binary into the `bin/` directory. * `make test` : Runs the unit tests for the project. This is an alias for `make unit-test` . * `make unit-test` : Runs the fast, isolated unit tests and generates a `unit.cover` profile.\n* `make integration-test` : Builds a coverage-instrumented binary and runs it against a suite of real-world scenarios, generating an `integration.cover` profile. * `make test-cover` : The primary test target. It runs both `unit-test` and `integration-test` , and then merges their coverage profiles to produce an aggregated total coverage report for the project. * `make setup` : Installs the necessary Go tools for the project, such as `gopls` . * `make clean` : Removes all build and test artifacts. ## About\n\nTest query is a command line tool to query test results with a SQL interface\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme]()\n\n### License\n\n[Apache-2.0 license](.0-1-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!

      "[Skip to main content](#)\n\n[**Testing Library**](/) [Docs](/docs/) [Examples](/docs/recipes)\n\n[Help](/help) [Blog](/blog)\n\nSearch\n\n* [](/)\n* Core API\n* Queries\n* About Queries\n\nOn this page\n\n# About Queries\n\n## Overview [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\nQueries are the methods that Testing Library gives you to find elements on the\npage. There are several [types of queries]() (\"get\", \"find\",\n\"query\"); the difference between them is whether the query will throw an error\nif no element is found or if it will return a Promise and retry. Depending on\nwhat page content you are selecting, different queries may be more or less\nappropriate. See the [priority guide]() for recommendations on how to\nmake use of semantic queries to test your page in the most accessible way.\nAfter selecting an element, you can use the [Events API](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events) or [user-event](/docs/user-event/intro) to fire events and simulate user interactions\nwith the page, or use Jest and [jest-dom](/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) to make\nassertions about the element. There are Testing Library helper methods that work with queries. As elements\nappear and disappear in response to actions, [Async APIs](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) like [`waitFor`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) or [`findBy` queries](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) can be used\nto await the changes in the DOM. To find only elements that are children of a\nspecific element, you can use [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) . If\nnecessary, there are also a few options you can [configure](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-configuration) , like the timeout for\nretries and the default testID attribute.\n## Example [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\n```\nimport { render ,  screen } from '@testing-library/react' // (or /dom, /vue, ...)  \n   \n test ( 'should show login form' , ( ) => {  \n render ( < Login /> )  \n const  input  =  screen . getByLabelText ( 'Username' )  \n // Events and assertions...  \n } )\n```\n\n## Types of Queries [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\n* Single Elements\n  \n    + `getBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive\n        error if no elements match _or_ if more than one match is found (use `getAllBy` instead if more than one element is expected). + `queryBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and return `null` if no\n        elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present. Throws an error if more than one match is found (use `queryAllBy` instead if\n        this is OK). + `findBy...` : Returns a Promise which resolves when an element is found which\n        matches the given query.\n ... \n### `screen` [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\nAll of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a `container` as the\nfirst argument. Because querying the entire `document.body` is very common, DOM\nTesting Library also exports a `screen` object which has every query that is\npre-bound to `document.body` (using the [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) functionality). Wrappers such as\nReact Testing Library re-export `screen` so you can use it the same way. Here's how you use it:\n\n* Native\n* React\n* Angular\n* Cypress\n\n```\nimport { screen } from '@testing-library/dom'  \n   \n document . body . innerHTML = `  \n < label for = \" example \" > Example </ label >  \n < input id = \" example \" />  \n `  \n   \n const  exampleInput  =  screen .\n ... \nUse a testid if\nyou have to, to make your intention to fall back to non-semantic queries clear\nand establish a stable API contract in the HTML. ```\n// @testing-library/react  \n const { container } = render ( < MyComponent /> )  \n const  foo  =  container . querySelector ( '[data-foo=\"bar\"]' )\n```\n\n## Browser extension [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\nDo you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries? There is a very cool Browser extension for Chrome named [Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano) ,\nand it helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to\ninspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's Developer Tools, and provides\nyou with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing\npractices.\n## Playground [​]( \"Direct link to heading\")\n\nIf you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com) . Testing Playground is\nan interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own\nhtml, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above.

      "Sometimes when I’ve been looking at a project for so long my eyes glaze over and I miss something obvious. Don’t worry this happens to all of us from time to time. 2. **Use different validation methods. ** I like to use a variety of methods when I validate. For instance, if the query aggregate data, I’ll cross validate with raw data using a tool like Excel. This diverse approach strengthens validations and reduces errors. ## Conclusion\n\nWhile the validation process may seem tedious, it’s necessary. Getting accurate data ensures the you’re basing insights off of reliable data and helps the business make informed decisions. As a data analyst, you’ll probably be spending a lot more of your time on cleaning and validation than you think. It’s not the most exciting task you’ll do, it is the foundation of developing accurate data driven decisions."
