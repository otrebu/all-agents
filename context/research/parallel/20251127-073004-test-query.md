# How do you test SQL queries?

[Discussion](/r/SQL/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22) Hey all,

Just wondering what you think is the best SQL testing paradigm. I know there isn't really a standard SQL testing framework but at work, we currently run tests on queries through Pytest against databases set up in containers.

I'm more interested in the way you typically set up your mocks and structure your tests. I typically set up a mock for each table interrogated by my queries. Each table is populated with all combinations of data that will test different parts of the query.

For every query tested, the database is therefore set up the exact same way. For every test, the query results would therefore also be identical. I just set up different test functions that assert on the different conditions of the result that we're interested in.

My team seems to have different approach though. It's not entirely consistent across the org but the pattern more closely resembles every test having their own specific set of mocks. Sometimes mocks are shared, but the data is mutated to fit the test case before populating the DB.

I'm not super experienced with SQL and the best practices around it. Though I'm mostly just trying to leverage Pytest fixtures to keep as much of the setup logic centralised in one place.

Would appreciate everyone's input on the matter! Share

# TestQuery

[]()

> This is not an officially supported Google product. > 
> 

[](https://github.com/danicat/testquery/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Test Query (tq) is a command line tool to query Go test results with a SQL interface.
 ... 
It is currently under development so it doesn't support a lot of information yet, but it is already possible to query basic information about tests, including:

* What tests are passing or not (all\_tests, passed\_tests, failed\_tests)
* What is the overall coverage (all\_coverage)
* What is the coverage provided by an individual test (test\_coverage)

## Usage

[]()

`tq` provides two main modes of operation: in-memory and file-based. * **In-Memory (Default):** For quick, ephemeral queries, `tq` can run tests and build a database entirely in memory. No files are created on disk. * **File-Based:** For more persistent analysis, you can first build a database file and then run multiple queries against it. ### Commands

[]()

There are three main commands: `build` , `query` , and `shell` . #### `tq build`

[]()

Builds a persistent SQLite database file from a Go package. This is the primary way to create a database for later analysis.
```
#  Build a database from the testdata package 
./bin/tq build --pkg ./testdata/ --output tq.db
```

#### `tq query`

[]()

Executes a single, non-interactive query. ```
#  Run an in-memory query against the testdata package 
./bin/tq query --pkg ./testdata/ " SELECT * FROM failed_tests " 

 #  Run a query against a pre-built database file 
./bin/tq query --db tq.db " SELECT * FROM failed_tests "
```

#### `tq shell`

[]()

Starts an interactive SQL shell. ```
#  Start an in-memory shell for the testdata package 
./bin/tq shell --pkg ./testdata/

 #  Start a shell using a pre-built database file 
./bin/tq shell --db tq.db
```

### Command-Line Help

[]()

You can get more information about the available commands and flags by using the `--help` flag. ```
% ./bin/tq --help
TestQuery (tq) is a command-line tool that allows you to query Go test results using a SQL interface.
It is designed to help developers understand and analyze tests in their projects,
especially in large and mature codebases. Usage:
  tq [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command 
  query       Execute a single query. shell       Start an interactive SQL shell. Flags:
  -h, --help   help for tq

Use " tq [command] --help " for more information about a command. ```

### Makefile Targets

[]()

The `Makefile` provides several targets to standardize the development and testing workflow:

* `make build` : Compiles the `tq` binary into the `bin/` directory. * `make test` : Runs the unit tests for the project. This is an alias for `make unit-test` . * `make unit-test` : Runs the fast, isolated unit tests and generates a `unit.cover` profile.
* `make integration-test` : Builds a coverage-instrumented binary and runs it against a suite of real-world scenarios, generating an `integration.cover` profile. * `make test-cover` : The primary test target. It runs both `unit-test` and `integration-test` , and then merges their coverage profiles to produce an aggregated total coverage report for the project. * `make setup` : Installs the necessary Go tools for the project, such as `gopls` . * `make clean` : Removes all build and test artifacts. ## About

## 4. [Efficient way to check if a SQL query will return results - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708815/efficient-way-to-check-if-a-sql-query-will-return-results)

**URL:** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708815/efficient-way-to-check-if-a-sql-query-will-return-results
**Domain:** stackoverflow.com

**Excerpt:**

The final results will actually be a far more complex query, taking one to many parameters and the string built up and executed using sp\_executesql

My question is lets say the 'count' would return 376986 and takes 4 seconds to calculate. Is using the IF EXISTS going to stop as soon as it find 1 row that satisfies the criteria. I'm deciding wether to use IF EXISTS or just query the @@ROWCOUNT and see if it is greater than zero. I did try some tests and both pretty much ran at the same speed but in 2 years time when there's alot more data is it likely using IF EXISTS is going to be a performance gain or not?
Thanks

For performance comparison, just ensure you are testing fairly by clearing down the data and execution plan caches (non-production db server only) before each test:

This depends on the DBMS's query optimizer. If his tests show that it takes 4 seconds with both IF EXISTS and COUNT, then IF EXISTS is likely not optimized. 0 Reply

For now the results are the same but i was querying more for the future. As the number of rows increased I wondered if the count performance would get slower.
 ... 
I would just return select exists instead of making it an int

```
SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM MY_TABLE);
```

It will return:

[](/posts/1708898/timeline "Show activity on this post.") First off, you should try to dummy up a database containing as much data as you think you (or your successors) might have to deal with in two years. Then your tests will be a lot more productive. IF EXISTS() will be faster, since the database engine only has to find a first matching record to your criteria.

# About Queries

## Overview [​]( "Direct link to heading")

Queries are the methods that Testing Library gives you to find elements on the
page. There are several [types of queries]() ("get", "find",
"query"); the difference between them is whether the query will throw an error
if no element is found or if it will return a Promise and retry. Depending on
what page content you are selecting, different queries may be more or less
appropriate. See the [priority guide]() for recommendations on how to
make use of semantic queries to test your page in the most accessible way.
After selecting an element, you can use the [Events API](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events) or [user-event](/docs/user-event/intro) to fire events and simulate user interactions
with the page, or use Jest and [jest-dom](/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) to make
assertions about the element. There are Testing Library helper methods that work with queries. As elements
appear and disappear in response to actions, [Async APIs](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) like [`waitFor`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) or [`findBy` queries](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) can be used
to await the changes in the DOM. To find only elements that are children of a
specific element, you can use [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) . If
necessary, there are also a few options you can [configure](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-configuration) , like the timeout for
retries and the default testID attribute.
## Example [​]( "Direct link to heading")

```
import { render ,  screen } from '@testing-library/react' // (or /dom, /vue, ...)  
   
 test ( 'should show login form' , ( ) => {  
 render ( < Login /> )  
 const  input  =  screen . getByLabelText ( 'Username' )  
 // Events and assertions...  
 } )
```

## Types of Queries [​]( "Direct link to heading")

* Single Elements
  
    + `getBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive
        error if no elements match _or_ if more than one match is found (use `getAllBy` instead if more than one element is expected). + `queryBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and return `null` if no
        elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present. Throws an error if more than one match is found (use `queryAllBy` instead if
        this is OK). + `findBy...` : Returns a Promise which resolves when an element is found which
        matches the given query.
 ... 
### `screen` [​]( "Direct link to heading")

All of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a `container` as the
first argument. Because querying the entire `document.body` is very common, DOM
Testing Library also exports a `screen` object which has every query that is
pre-bound to `document.body` (using the [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) functionality). Wrappers such as
React Testing Library re-export `screen` so you can use it the same way. Here's how you use it:

* Native
* React
* Angular
* Cypress

```
import { screen } from '@testing-library/dom'  
   
 document . body . innerHTML = `  
 < label for = " example " > Example </ label >  
 < input id = " example " />  
 `  
   
 const  exampleInput  =  screen .
 ... 
Use a testid if
you have to, to make your intention to fall back to non-semantic queries clear
and establish a stable API contract in the HTML. ```
// @testing-library/react  
 const { container } = render ( < MyComponent /> )  
 const  foo  =  container . querySelector ( '[data-foo="bar"]' )
```

## Browser extension [​]( "Direct link to heading")

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries? There is a very cool Browser extension for Chrome named [Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano) ,
and it helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to
inspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's Developer Tools, and provides
you with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing
practices.
## Playground [​]( "Direct link to heading")

If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com) . Testing Playground is
an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own
html, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above. [Edit this page](https://github.com/testing-library/testing-library-docs/edit/main/docs/queries/about.mdx)

## 6. [How to Validate SQL Query Results - Kelly Adams](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/how-to-validate-sql-query-results)

**URL:** https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/how-to-validate-sql-query-results
**Domain:** www.kellyjadams.com

**Excerpt:**

Sometimes when I’ve been looking at a project for so long my eyes glaze over and I miss something obvious. Don’t worry this happens to all of us from time to time. 2. **Use different validation methods. ** I like to use a variety of methods when I validate. For instance, if the query aggregate data, I’ll cross validate with raw data using a tool like Excel. This diverse approach strengthens validations and reduces errors. ## Conclusion

While the validation process may seem tedious, it’s necessary. Getting accurate data ensures the you’re basing insights off of reliable data and helps the business make informed decisions. As a data analyst, you’ll probably be spending a lot more of your time on cleaning and validation than you think. It’s not the most exciting task you’ll do, it is the foundation of developing accurate data driven decisions.

## 9. [Defining a query-based test - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/gdp/12.x?topic=assessments-defining-query-based-test)

**URL:** https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/gdp/12.x?topic=assessments-defining-query-based-test
**Domain:** www.ibm.com

**Excerpt:**

Note: The detail generated
    is only displayed when the query-based test fails; allowing the user
    to enter a SQL statement that can retrieve the information that caused
    the test to fail and help identify the cause of failure. Note: Detail
    string can be seen within a Security Assessment Results by clicking
    on the Assessment Test Name and also queried through the Result Details
    attribute of the Test Result Entity. 14. **Optional:** Enter a Pre-test check SQL statement . This statement is run before running the test. If the statement returns 0, the test is not run. If the test returns 1 or an error, the test is run. 15. **Optional:** Enter a Pre-test fail message . This message is inserted into the assessment results if the test is not run due to the SQL statement returning 0. 16. **Optional:** In Loop databases , enter a list of databases through which the test should loop. The test returns the union or sum of the results returned from all the specified databases.

**Excerpt:**

@Test
fun `gteq doubles`() {
val schema = Schema(listOf(
Field("a", ArrowTypes.DoubleType),
Field("b", ArrowTypes.DoubleType)
))
val a: List<Double> = listOf(0.0, 1.0,
Double.MIN_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.NaN)
val b = a.reversed()
val batch = createRecordBatch(schema, listOf(a,b))
val expr = GtEqExpression(ColumnExpression(0), ColumnExpression(1))
val result = expr.evaluate(batch)
assertEquals(a.size, result.size())
(0 until result.size()).forEach {
assertEquals(if (a[it] >= b[it]) 1 else 0, result.getValue(it))
}
}
Integration Testing
Once unit tests are in place, the next step is to write integration tests that execute queries consisting of multiple operators and expressions and assert that they produce the expected output. There are a few popular approaches to integration testing of query engines:
    * Imperative Testing: Hard-coded queries and expected results, either written as code or stored as files containing the queries and results.

**URL:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-test-query
**Domain:** learn.microsoft.com

**Excerpt:**

As soon as you upload the file, you can also see the file contents in the form as a table or in it's raw format. If you select **Reset** , the sample data will return to the incoming input data explained in the previous section. You can upload any other file to test the query at any time. 7. Select **Test query** to test your query against the uploaded sample file. 8. Test results are shown based on your query. You can change your query and select **Save query** to test the new query logic. This allows you to iteratively modify your query and test it again to see how the output changes. 9. When you use multiple outputs in the query, the results are shown based on selected output. 10. After you verify the results shown in the browser, you can **Start** the job. ## Limitations

1. Time policy is not supported in portal testing:
   
    + Out-of-order: all incoming events will be ordered.

**Excerpt:**

Please see Adding a Database Connection for more information on adding a database connection . 4\. In the **Row Limit** field, we enter or set the number of records or rows we want to display from the query result. In this example, we have set it as 10. 5\. In the **Variable** field, enter the variable name where the query result will be stored and define the variable’s scope. In this example, the query result will be captured in the _SourceData_ variable, as shown in the screenshot above. Select the appropriate option from the drop-down to define the variable’s scope. In this example, we have selected the scope as a **Test** . The options available for the scope of the variable are as given below:

* **Global** – The variable’s scope is global and available throughout. * **Folder** – The variable’s scope is limited to the test cases in the specific folder. * **Test** – the scope of the variable is limited to the test case. When the test case ends, this variable will be deleted.
