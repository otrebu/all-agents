# Task: TASK-ORPHAN-001 - Create user profile page

**Status:** Completed

## Description

Create a basic user profile page that displays essential user information. This is a technical task without a user story parent - an orphan task created directly for infrastructure/technical needs.

## Scope

- Display user name on profile page
- Display user email
- Show account creation date

## Subtasks

- ORPHAN-001: Create user profile page

## Notes

This task has no parent Story (storyRef). It was created as a standalone technical task. The intention drift analysis should handle this gracefully by validating only at the Task → Subtask level.
