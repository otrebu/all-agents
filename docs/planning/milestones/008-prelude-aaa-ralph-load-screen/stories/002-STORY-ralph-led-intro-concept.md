## Story: Ralph-Led Intro Concept Is Documented

### Narrative
As a returning Ralph workflow user, I want a Ralph-led startup logo and mascot concept so that I can instantly recognize Ralph mode and feel continuity with prior sessions.

### Persona
A frequent Ralph operator who runs planning, build, and review loops daily. They care about recognizable Ralph personality cues that remain compact and readable in terminal workflows.

### Context
Milestone 008 explicitly calls for two concept variants. The Ralph-led direction is required to compare brand emphasis options before committing to a default intro.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A concise concept note defines one Ralph-led logo and mascot direction for startup intro use
- [ ] The concept remains legible in plain-text terminal environments, including monochrome fallback
- [ ] The concept makes Ralph the primary identity while preserving subtle AAA framing

### Tasks
<!-- Tasks will be generated separately via tasks-auto.md -->
- [ ] Tasks to be defined

### Notes
The Ralph-led concept should feel playful but not distract from immediate command context.
