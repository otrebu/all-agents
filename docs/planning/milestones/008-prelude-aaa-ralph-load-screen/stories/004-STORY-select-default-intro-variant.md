## Story: Default Intro Variant Is Selected With Rationale

### Narrative
As a product owner guiding Ralph experience direction, I want one intro variant selected with clear rationale so that the team can implement a default without ambiguity.

### Persona
A product decision-maker balancing brand identity, user readability, and implementation risk. They care about a crisp decision record that avoids reopening the same debate later.

### Context
Milestone 008 outcome is not implementation, but selection. The roadmap requires an explicit default choice and documented rationale grounded in terminal compatibility and identity clarity.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] One variant is explicitly marked as the default intro direction
- [ ] A concise rationale compares both variants on readability, identity clarity, and terminal fit
- [ ] The decision note confirms no blocking risks around wrapping, size, or non-ASCII dependency
- [ ] The milestone decision record stays scoped to exploration and selection only

### Tasks
<!-- Tasks will be generated separately via tasks-auto.md -->
- [ ] Tasks to be defined

### Notes
Include enough rationale to support handoff without adding implementation details.
