## Story: AAA-Led Intro Concept Is Documented

### Narrative
As a first-time AAA CLI user, I want an AAA-led startup logo and mascot concept so that I can immediately recognize the tool in a noisy terminal.

### Persona
A developer or operator running `aaa` commands in terminal sessions all day. They care about fast visual recognition and a friendly first impression without sacrificing readability.

### Context
Milestone 008 requires two alternate intro concepts. The AAA-led direction is one of the required deliverables and must be clear enough to evaluate as a default candidate.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A concise concept note defines one AAA-led logo and mascot direction for startup intro use
- [ ] The concept is readable in plain terminal contexts and does not depend on color to be understood
- [ ] The concept keeps AAA as the primary identity while still signaling Ralph as part of the experience

### Tasks
- [ ] [001-TASK-aaa-led-intro-concept-note](../tasks/001-TASK-aaa-led-intro-concept-note.md) - Define the AAA-led logo and mascot concept note with ASCII/width verification steps

### Notes
Keep the concept terminal-safe and quickly scannable at first glance.
