Include the required sections (Identity Intent, Logo Direction, Mascot Direction, Monochrome Readability, AAA vs Ralph Signal), provide one ASCII sketch wrapped in AAA-ASCII markers and kept near 12-14 lines / <=72 columns, and add a Verification section with concrete shell commands for width, ASCII-only check, and terminal preview.",

        "[Behavioral] The concept note defines exactly one AAA-led logo direction and one Ralph-supporting mascot direction with explicit AAA-primary rationale",
        "[Visual] The fenced text sketch between AAA-ASCII markers is monochrome-readable, roughly 12-14 lines, and no content line exceeds 72 columns",
        "[Regression] The note states Ralph as secondary signal and avoids introducing runtime implementation scope beyond design guidance",
        "[Evidence] The Verification section includes executable shell commands for width check, ASCII-only check, and plain-terminal preview of the note"
