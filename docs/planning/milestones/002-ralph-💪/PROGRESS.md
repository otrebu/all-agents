# Milestone Progress: Ralph 002

## 2026-01-25

### SUB-012
- **Problem:** Need to define the interrogation workflow for surfacing assumptions and confidence levels in code changes
- **Changes:** Created context/workflows/interrogate.md with:
  - 3 core questions (hardest decision, rejected alternatives, lowest confidence)
  - Default, --quick, and --skeptical modes
  - Structured output format with confidence levels and tables
  - Target options (changes, commit, pr)
  - Integration guidance with code review workflow
- **Files:** context/workflows/interrogate.md (created)

### SUB-013
- **Problem:** Need a skill command to invoke the interrogation workflow with git context
- **Changes:** Created .claude/commands/dev/interrogate.md with:
  - Proper frontmatter (description, allowed-tools, argument-hint)
  - Target argument parsing (changes, commit, pr)
  - Mode flags support (--quick, --skeptical)
  - Git context gathering commands for each target type
  - Reference to interrogate workflow document
- **Files:** .claude/commands/dev/interrogate.md (created)

### SUB-014
- **Problem:** Need to integrate interrogation workflow into the complete-feature workflow as a pre-merge checkpoint
- **Changes:** Updated context/workflows/complete-feature.md with:
  - Added step 4 "Interrogation Checkpoint (Optional)" between storing branch name and squashing commits
  - Documents when interrogation is most valuable (substantial changes, AI code, uncertainty about trade-offs)
  - Shows invocation examples for default, --quick, and --skeptical modes
  - Renumbered subsequent steps (5-11)
- **Files:** context/workflows/complete-feature.md (modified)
