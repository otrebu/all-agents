# Milestone Progress: Ralph 002

## 2026-01-25

### SUB-012
- **Problem:** Need to define the interrogation workflow for surfacing assumptions and confidence levels in code changes
- **Changes:** Created context/workflows/interrogate.md with:
  - 3 core questions (hardest decision, rejected alternatives, lowest confidence)
  - Default, --quick, and --skeptical modes
  - Structured output format with confidence levels and tables
  - Target options (changes, commit, pr)
  - Integration guidance with code review workflow
- **Files:** context/workflows/interrogate.md (created)
