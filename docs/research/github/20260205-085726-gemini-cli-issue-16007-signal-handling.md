2. EVALUATION: Assessing Cardinal Suitability for Current Church Challenges
Beyond the realm of electoral politics, the next Pope will face a Catholic Church navigating a complex landscape of demographic shifts, governance reforms, doctrinal questions, and the imperative of evangelization in the modern world. Evaluating which of the aforementioned cardinals would be most effective in addressing these specific challenges, independent of their electoral prospects, provides a crucial perspective on the future direction of the Church.

Demographic Shifts:
The Catholic Church is currently experiencing significant demographic shifts, with a notable increase in the Catholic population in Africa and Asia, while Europe and the Americas face stagnation or decline.121 This reality presents both opportunities for growth and challenges in terms of resource allocation, pastoral care, and ensuring the Church's leadership reflects its increasingly global composition. The future vitality of the Catholic Church is intrinsically linked to its ability to effectively engage with and support the burgeoning Catholic communities in the Global South.
In this context, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, as a Filipino cardinal, possesses a unique advantage in understanding and connecting with the Asian context, where Catholicism is experiencing dynamic growth.1 His current role as Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelisation further underscores his focus on these regions and their specific needs.4 A pontificate under Cardinal Tagle could signal a significant embrace of the Church's growing presence in Asia.
Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost's extensive missionary work and leadership in Peru and Latin America also provide him with valuable firsthand experience in another region with a substantial and growing Catholic population.4 His deep engagement with the Catholic communities in Latin America equips him with insights into their specific challenges and opportunities.
While the growth is concentrated in the Global South, the challenges of maintaining faith in increasingly secularized societies in Europe and the Americas remain significant. Cardinal Péter Erdő's leadership within the Council of European Episcopal Conferences has exposed him to the complexities of secularization and the need for renewed evangelization efforts in Europe.4 His experience could be beneficial in addressing these specific regional challenges.
The possibility of the first African or Asian Pope (beyond Cardinal Tagle, figures like Cardinal Turkson have been mentioned 1) underscores the potential for a historic shift in the papacy, reflecting the changing demographics of the global Catholic community. Such an election would carry immense symbolic weight, signaling the Church's universality and its commitment to its growing communities in the Global South.

Governance Reform:
The Catholic Church has been engaged in ongoing efforts to reform the Roman Curia, aiming for greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency, particularly in areas concerning finance and the handling of abuse cases.130 The next Pope will need to continue these reforms and foster a culture of good governance within the Vatican.
Cardinal Pietro Parolin's extensive tenure as Secretary of State provides him with an intimate understanding of the Curia and its internal workings.4 Having been part of Pope Francis' Council of Cardinals advising on Church reform, he possesses firsthand knowledge of the reforms already implemented and the challenges that remain.14 His experience could be instrumental in navigating the complexities of further Curial reform, though his approach might be characterized by a degree of caution given his long-standing role within the existing system.
Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, as the current Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, holds a significant administrative position within the Vatican.4 His leadership of this key dicastery, along with his previous experience as the head of a religious order, demonstrates his administrative capabilities and his potential to lead further governance reforms within the Church.
Cardinal Péter Erdő's experience as the Archbishop of a major archdiocese and his leadership of the Council of European Episcopal Conferences showcase his capacity for governance at different levels of the Church.4 This broad experience could be valuable in implementing and overseeing governance reforms at both the Vatican and local levels.

Doctrinal Questions:
The Catholic Church in the 21st century grapples with a range of complex doctrinal questions, including the interpretation and implementation of Vatican II, the evolving roles of women in the Church, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ Catholics, and ethical considerations arising from advancements in science and technology.6 The next Pope will need to provide theological leadership and pastoral guidance in navigating these often sensitive and divisive issues.
Cardinal Erdő, representing a more conservative theological perspective, would likely prioritize upholding traditional doctrines and liturgical practices.5 His firm stance on issues such as communion for divorced and remarried Catholics reflects this commitment to traditional teachings.5
Cardinal Tagle, with his liberal leanings, would likely approach these issues with a greater emphasis on compassion and inclusion.1 His background suggests a willingness to engage with contemporary challenges in a way that seeks to be both faithful to the Gospel and responsive to the needs of the modern world.
Cardinal Parolin, positioned as a moderate, might adopt a more centrist approach, seeking to maintain a degree of continuity with Pope Francis' reforms while also being mindful of the concerns of more traditional elements within the Church.5
Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, while considered soft conservative, brings a unique perspective from his role as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.5 His experience in a religiously diverse region might inform a nuanced approach to doctrinal questions, emphasizing dialogue and understanding, particularly in interreligious contexts.
Cardinal Prevost, with his background as a canon lawyer, might approach doctrinal questions with a focus on Church law and established theological principles.66

Evangelization:
The imperative of evangelization remains a central mission of the Catholic Church in an increasingly secular and diverse world. Declining church attendance and disaffiliation, particularly among younger generations, highlight the urgent need for effective strategies to reach out to both active and disengaged Catholics.152 The next Pope will need to inspire and guide the Church in its efforts to share the Gospel in contemporary society.
Cardinal Tagle's current role as Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelisation directly positions him at the forefront of the Church's missionary efforts.4 His reputation as a charismatic communicator with a strong connection to the poor and youth further enhances his suitability to lead the Church's evangelization initiatives.8
Cardinal Erdő has also recognized the importance of the New Evangelization and the need to engage with younger generations.26 His participation in city missions in Europe demonstrates a commitment to reaching out beyond the traditional parish setting.32
Cardinal Pizzaballa's extensive experience in the Holy Land, interacting with pilgrims from diverse backgrounds and engaging deeply with the Scriptures, could inform an approach to evangelization that emphasizes encounter, dialogue, and a profound understanding of the foundational texts of the faith.5

AI-driven solutions have made inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts."}

We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.'}

A key challenge lies in the transferability of bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs. The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.'}

It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity."}

To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**, and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions.

Recent HTC approaches use various techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed beneficial.'}

Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability."}

Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463 sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation, Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits. These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping model biases.'}

Typically, AL methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this, we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \\textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft \\textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \\textbf{A}ctive \\textbf{L}earning). This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution, thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently, based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible."}

In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions, including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German. The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity, and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both along and against existing social stereotypes."}

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.'}

We propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM, each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously, enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller, independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains."}

Unlike conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains, requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input queries.

We propose a method to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks."}

In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.'}

We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences).

Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal.

Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.'}

This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable format for ad-hoc searches.\nWe implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.'}

The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.'}

Six frontier models, including three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 % of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.

Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.'}

We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data."}
