# How do you test SQL queries? [Discussion](/r/SQL/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)

Hey all,

Just wondering what you think is the best SQL testing paradigm. I know there isn't really a standard SQL testing framework but at work, we currently run tests on queries through Pytest against databases set up in containers. I'm more interested in the way you typically set up your mocks and structure your tests. I typically set up a mock for each table interrogated by my queries.
Each table is populated with all combinations of data that will test different parts of the query. For every query tested, the database is therefore set up the exact same way. For every test, the query results would therefore also be identical. I just set up different test functions that assert on the different conditions of the result that we're interested in. My team seems to have different approach though. It's not entirely consistent across the org but the pattern more closely resembles every test having their own specific set of mocks. Sometimes mocks are shared, but the data is mutated to fit the test case before populating the DB. I'm not super experienced with SQL and the best practices around it. Though I'm mostly just trying to leverage Pytest fixtures to keep as much of the setup logic centralised in one place. Would appreciate everyone's input on the matter!

We have a live/production database server and a test/development server. Any queries that will run on production are run on the dev server first. They are identical databases. Worse case you crash the dev server with a bad query (seldom happens). Then we restrict the people allowed to run queries on the production server. track me

I have run into a problem wherein we keep having complex SQL queries go out with errors. Essentially this results in sending mail to the incorrect customers and other 'problems' like that. What is everyone's experience with creating SQL queries like that? We are creating new cohorts of data every other week. So here are some of my thoughts and the limitations to them:

* **Creating test data** Whilst this would prove that we have all the correct data it does not enforce the exclusion of anomalies in production. That is data that would be considered wrong today but may have been correct 10 years ago; it wasn't documented and therefore we only know about it after the data is extracted. * **Create Venn diagrams and data maps** This seems to be a solid way to test the design of a query, however it doesn't guarantee that the implementation is correct. It gets the developers planning ahead and thinking of what is happening as they write.
Thanks for any input you can give to my problem. * [sql](/questions/tagged/sql "show questions tagged 'sql'")

Here's our first test:

```
--a select statement that catenates the test name and the case statement
select concat( 
-- the test name
'For every (year, month) there is one and only one (absolute_month): ', 
-- the case statement
   case when 
-- one or more subqueries
-- in this case, an expected value and an actual value 
-- that must be equal for the test to pass
  ( select count(distinct year, month) from month_value) 
  --expected value,
  = ( select count(distinct absolute_month) from cm_absolute_month)  
  -- actual value
  -- the then and else branches of the case statement
  then 'passed' else 'failed' end
  -- close the concat function and terminate the query 
  ); 
  -- test result. ```

Running that query produces this result: `For every (year, month) there is one and only one (absolute_month): passed`

As long as there is sufficient test data in month\_value, this test works.

# TestQuery

[]()

> This is not an officially supported Google product. > 
> 

[](https://github.com/danicat/testquery/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Test Query (tq) is a command line tool to query Go test results with a SQL interface.
 ... 
It is currently under development so it doesn't support a lot of information yet, but it is already possible to query basic information about tests, including:

* What tests are passing or not (all\_tests, passed\_tests, failed\_tests)
* What is the overall coverage (all\_coverage)
* What is the coverage provided by an individual test (test\_coverage)

## Usage

[]()

`tq` provides two main modes of operation: in-memory and file-based. * **In-Memory (Default):** For quick, ephemeral queries, `tq` can run tests and build a database entirely in memory. No files are created on disk. * **File-Based:** For more persistent analysis, you can first build a database file and then run multiple queries against it. ### Commands

[]()

There are three main commands: `build` , `query` , and `shell` . #### `tq build`

[]()

Builds a persistent SQLite database file from a Go package. This is the primary way to create a database for later analysis.
```
#  Build a database from the testdata package 
./bin/tq build --pkg ./testdata/ --output tq.db
```

#### `tq query`

[]()

Executes a single, non-interactive query. ```
#  Run an in-memory query against the testdata package 
./bin/tq query --pkg ./testdata/ " SELECT * FROM failed_tests " 

 #  Run a query against a pre-built database file 
./bin/tq query --db tq.db " SELECT * FROM failed_tests "
```

#### `tq shell`

[]()

Starts an interactive SQL shell. ```
#  Start an in-memory shell for the testdata package 
./bin/tq shell --pkg ./testdata/

 #  Start a shell using a pre-built database file 
./bin/tq shell --db tq.db
```

### Command-Line Help

[]()

You can get more information about the available commands and flags by using the `--help` flag. ```
% ./bin/tq --help
TestQuery (tq) is a command-line tool that allows you to query Go test results using a SQL interface.
It is designed to help developers understand and analyze tests in their projects,
especially in large and mature codebases. Usage:
  tq [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command 
  query       Execute a single query. shell       Start an interactive SQL shell. Flags:
  -h, --help   help for tq

Use " tq [command] --help " for more information about a command. ```

### Makefile Targets

[]()

The `Makefile` provides several targets to standardize the development and testing workflow:

* `make build` : Compiles the `tq` binary into the `bin/` directory. * `make test` : Runs the unit tests for the project. This is an alias for `make unit-test` . * `make unit-test` : Runs the fast, isolated unit tests and generates a `unit.cover` profile.
* `make integration-test` : Builds a coverage-instrumented binary and runs it against a suite of real-world scenarios, generating an `integration.cover` profile. * `make test-cover` : The primary test target. It runs both `unit-test` and `integration-test` , and then merges their coverage profiles to produce an aggregated total coverage report for the project. * `make setup` : Installs the necessary Go tools for the project, such as `gopls` . * `make clean` : Removes all build and test artifacts. ## About

# About Queries

## Overview [​]( "Direct link to heading")

Queries are the methods that Testing Library gives you to find elements on the
page. There are several [types of queries]() ("get", "find",
"query"); the difference between them is whether the query will throw an error
if no element is found or if it will return a Promise and retry. Depending on
what page content you are selecting, different queries may be more or less
appropriate. See the [priority guide]() for recommendations on how to
make use of semantic queries to test your page in the most accessible way.
After selecting an element, you can use the [Events API](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events) or [user-event](/docs/user-event/intro) to fire events and simulate user interactions
with the page, or use Jest and [jest-dom](/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) to make
assertions about the element. There are Testing Library helper methods that work with queries. As elements
appear and disappear in response to actions, [Async APIs](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) like [`waitFor`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) or [`findBy` queries](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async) can be used
to await the changes in the DOM. To find only elements that are children of a
specific element, you can use [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) . If
necessary, there are also a few options you can [configure](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-configuration) , like the timeout for
retries and the default testID attribute.
## Example [​]( "Direct link to heading")

```
import { render ,  screen } from '@testing-library/react' // (or /dom, /vue, ...)  
   
 test ( 'should show login form' , ( ) => {  
 render ( < Login /> )  
 const  input  =  screen . getByLabelText ( 'Username' )  
 // Events and assertions...  
 } )
```

## Types of Queries [​]( "Direct link to heading")

* Single Elements
  
    + `getBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive
        error if no elements match _or_ if more than one match is found (use `getAllBy` instead if more than one element is expected). + `queryBy...` : Returns the matching node for a query, and return `null` if no
        elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present. Throws an error if more than one match is found (use `queryAllBy` instead if
        this is OK). + `findBy...` : Returns a Promise which resolves when an element is found which
        matches the given query.
 ... 
### `screen` [​]( "Direct link to heading")

All of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a `container` as the
first argument. Because querying the entire `document.body` is very common, DOM
Testing Library also exports a `screen` object which has every query that is
pre-bound to `document.body` (using the [`within`](/docs/dom-testing-library/api-within) functionality). Wrappers such as
React Testing Library re-export `screen` so you can use it the same way. Here's how you use it:

* Native
* React
* Angular
* Cypress

```
import { screen } from '@testing-library/dom'  
   
 document . body . innerHTML = `  
 < label for = " example " > Example </ label >  
 < input id = " example " />  
 `  
   
 const  exampleInput  =  screen .
 ... 
Use a testid if
you have to, to make your intention to fall back to non-semantic queries clear
and establish a stable API contract in the HTML. ```
// @testing-library/react  
 const { container } = render ( < MyComponent /> )  
 const  foo  =  container . querySelector ( '[data-foo="bar"]' )
```

## Browser extension [​]( "Direct link to heading")

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries? There is a very cool Browser extension for Chrome named [Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano) ,
and it helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to
inspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's Developer Tools, and provides
you with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing
practices.
## Playground [​]( "Direct link to heading")

If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com) . Testing Playground is
an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own
html, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above. [Edit this page](https://github.com/testing-library/testing-library-docs/edit/main/docs/queries/about.mdx)

**Excerpt:**

For performance comparison, just ensure you are testing fairly by clearing down the data and execution plan caches (non-production db server only) before each test:

```
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE
DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS
```

This depends on the DBMS's query optimizer. If his tests show that it takes 4 seconds with both IF EXISTS and COUNT, then IF EXISTS is likely not optimized. 0 Reply

For now the results are the same but i was querying more for the future. As the number of rows increased I wondered if the count performance would get slower.

# Querying Test Results

You can query test results for Confusion Matrix and Test Metrics from `ODMR_USER_WF_CLAS_TEST_RESULTS` and `ODMR_USER_WF_REGR_TEST_RESULTS` repository views. You can query the test results from:

* [ODMR\_USER\_WF\_CLAS\_TEST\_RESULTS](GUID-6D247651-FAFE-4E60-90F7-D8C458DAC8D3.htm "By using the ODMR_USER_WF_CLAS_TEST_RESULTS repository view, you can query the generated classification results for a specific mining model in the last workflow run.") Repository View
* [ODMR\_USER\_WF\_REGR\_TEST\_RESULTS](GUID-B3AC3A67-C5E0-4557-9549-643D3C6D1C82.htm "You can query the generated regression results for a specific mining model in the last workflow run by using the ODMR_USER_WF_REGR_TEST_RESULTS repository view.")

## 14. [Query diagnostics - Power Query](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/query-diagnostics)

**URL:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/query-diagnostics
**Domain:** learn.microsoft.com

**Excerpt:**

To provide higher performance, currently some caching happens so that it doesn't have to rerun every part of the final query plan as it goes back through the steps. While this caching is useful for normal authoring, it means that you don't always get correct step comparison information because of later evaluations pulling on cached data. ## Diagnostics schema

### Id

When analyzing the results of a recording, it's important to filter the recording session by Id, so that columns such as Exclusive Duration % make sense. Id is a composite identifier. It's formed of two numbers—one before the dot, and one after. The first number is the same for all evaluations that resulted from a single user action. In other words, if you press refresh twice, there are two different numbers leading the dot, one for each user activity taken. This numbering is sequential for a given diagnostics recording. The second number represents an evaluation by the engine.
