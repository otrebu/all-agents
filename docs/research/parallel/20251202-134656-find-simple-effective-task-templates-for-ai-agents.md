They’re working products powered by Wippy._

Most companies talk about “AI integration.” We talk about AI agents doing real work. While others are still testing copilots and chatbots, we’ve seen companies radically improve software development workflows with autonomous, self-modifying AI agents running in production. Not prototypes – actual shipped tools solving painful problems for engineering teams. Below are three agent templates – built with Wippy – that you can steal, adapt, and deploy in your product or dev environment right now. ## 1\. CodeMind: The AI Codebase Translator for Legacy and Complex Projects

**Problem it solves:** **  
** Developers waste weeks trying to understand legacy codebases before they can ship anything. Institutional knowledge is stuck in tribal memory or scattered documentation. And onboarding new devs takes way too long. **What the agent does:**

* Parses your codebase, architecture, and documentation.
* Answers questions like:  
   “Where is the logic for discount calculation?”  
   “How does the auth system flow from login to access token?”
* Suggests large-scale refactors, validates impact, and can even execute structural changes autonomously. * Visualizes architectural patterns and warns when they’re being violated. **Best for:** **  
** Enterprise teams inheriting large or poorly documented codebases, or startups scaling beyond their original architecture. **How to use this agent:**

* Connect it to your repo and onboarding documentation. * Set up a read-only mode for new engineers to explore safely. Give tech leads the ability to accept/refactor directly from AI prompts. ## 2\. TestForge: The Self-Healing Test Suite That Never Goes Out of Sync

**Problem it solves:** **  
** Most test suites rot. Developers hate writing tests. And when something breaks, half the time it’s the test – not the code.
 ... 
* Auto-suggests code snippets tailored to your app, not random GitHub examples. * Integrates with your issue tracker and Slack for real-time context. * Automates your routine tasks like renaming variables across files, generating scaffolding, or committing with smart messages. **Best for:** **  
** Solo developers, small product teams, or companies tired of hiring more developers just to move faster. **Bonus:** **  
** The more you code, the smarter this agent gets. It learns not only how you write code – but why. ## Why These Agents Work (and What You Can Learn from Them)

These aren’t just bots spitting out code. They’re agentic systems:

✅ **Context-aware –** They know your systems, your users, your language. ✅ **Self-improving –** They refine behavior over time without constant re-training. ✅ **Isolated + Observable –** They run safely in environments like Wippy Runtime, giving you version control and real-time logs.

Innovative ways to use ChatGPT in finance

ChatGPT and other AI tools are increasingly being explored for their potential in the financial sector. While they offer innovative ways to streamline tasks and generate insights, it's crucial to understand their limitations and use them judiciously. Here are some innovative ways to use ChatGPT in finance, along with important considerations:

### Innovative Uses of ChatGPT in Finance

* **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** ChatGPT can be used to process and clean financial datasets, making them ready for further analysis. One Redditor shared their experience: ["I fed it a raw Yahoo! Finance CSV and told it to: 1. Clean the data (remove duplicates, fix typos) 2. Create bar, trend, and pie charts 3. Explain the financial metrics in plain English 4.
 ... 
["It's not advice, it's the average of everything it's been trained on, a modern variant of a search engine. Don't substitute confidence for wisdom. "](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nj39bb/comment/nenhjz1/) . * **Specific Numbers and Calculations:** ChatGPT can make mistakes when dealing with specific numbers or detailed calculations. ["If you ask for specific numbers, there’s a pretty good chance it will make a mistake. "](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nj39bb/comment/nenmms9/) . * **User Expertise Required:** To effectively use ChatGPT for financial tasks, users still need a good understanding of the subject to verify the output. ["Using AI is like using a financial advisor. You have to be knowledgeable enough to know if what it's telling you is accurate, and at that point you have enough knowledge to do it yourself. "](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nj39bb/comment/neov44k/) .

Hi folks,

This blog post is about a topic that’s close to my heart: **AI Agents** . I find them incredibly cool and useful! After working on numerous AI Agent use cases and running a global hackathon, with LangChain with participants from all around the world, to create unique Agents, I took the time to write this post to make the concept of AI Agents easy to understand. In this post, I’ll **explain what AI Agents are** and walk you through a simple example to help you **build your first Agent easily using LangGraph** . Subscribe

## Let’s start with some intro

The world of artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transformation. For years, we've built specialized AI models - each designed to excel at a specific task.
We have models that can write text, others that can analyze sentiment, and still others that can classify documents. These models are like skilled specialists, each performing their particular role with impressive expertise. But something has been missing: the ability to coordinate these capabilities, to understand context, and to make decisions about what to do next. Think about how a human expert approaches a complex task. When a detective investigates a case, they don't just collect evidence in isolation. They interview witnesses and, based on what they learn, decide which leads to pursue next. They might notice a contradiction that sends them back to re-examine earlier evidence. Each piece of information influences their next steps, and they maintain a complete picture of the investigation in their mind.
[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x1NL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab11acb8-4e67-4de5-9175-388c4705a4a5_1024x1024.webp)

## AI Agents

This fragmented approach to AI created significant challenges. It placed a heavy burden on users to manage complex workflows, lost valuable context between steps, and lacked the adaptability needed for real-world tasks. Each model operated in isolation, like specialists who couldn't communicate with each other or adjust their work based on what their colleagues discovered. This is where AI agents revolutionize the landscape. They represent a fundamental shift in how we approach artificial intelligence. An agent acts more like a skilled coordinator, orchestrating multiple capabilities while maintaining a holistic understanding of the task. It can make informed decisions about what to do next based on what it learns along the way, much like a human expert would.
## What Makes an AI Agent Different? To understand this transformation, let's examine how agents handle a specific task: analyzing a research paper about a new medical treatment. A traditional AI approach fragments the analysis into isolated steps: summarizing the paper, extracting key terms, categorizing the research type, and generating insights. Each model performs its task independently, blind to the others' findings. If the summary reveals that the paper's methodology is unclear, there's no automated way to circle back and examine that section more carefully. The process is rigid, predetermined, and often misses crucial connections. An AI agent, however, approaches the task with the adaptability of a human researcher. It might begin with a broad overview but can dynamically adjust its focus based on what it discovers. When it encounters significant methodological details, it can choose to analyze that section more thoroughly.
 ... 
This is where theory meets practice, and where we can truly understand the power of our graph-based approach. Let's test our agent with a concrete example:

```
sample_text = """
OpenAI has announced the GPT-4 model, which is a large multimodal model that exhibits human-level performance on various professional benchmarks. It is developed to improve the alignment and safety of AI systems. additionally, the model is designed to be more efficient and scalable than its predecessor, GPT-3. The GPT-4 model is expected to be released in the coming months and will be available to the public for research and development purposes.
"""

## 4. [10 best practices for building reliable AI agents in 2025](https://www.uipath.com/blog/ai/agent-builder-best-practices)

**URL:** https://www.uipath.com/blog/ai/agent-builder-best-practices
**Domain:** www.uipath.com

**Excerpt:**

* **For deterministic tasks, use tools** : bound risk by calling proven UiPath automations or APIs as tools rather than letting the agent directly act, when the use case demands it. This increases predictability and safety. * **Align agent goals and measurable outcomes** : define clear objectives, performance metrics, and success criteria before design begins. Agents should operate within measurable boundaries. ## 2\. Configure context the right way

* **Index your enterprise context** : index the structured sources, knowledge bases (KBs), and documentation your agent will rely on. Good planning and context setup are key to reliable execution. Make sure you choose the right search strategy. Semantic search finds meaning-based matches in unstructured text and structured search retrieves exact data from defined schemas.
[DeepRAG](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/integration-service/uipath-uipath-airdk-context-grounding-summary-deep-rag) combines both to reason deeply across large, complex, or mixed sources. * **Choose the right model** : UiPath Agent Builder in Studio is model-agnostic, therefore use the model best suited to your use case. GPT-5, for example, is generally more reliable than GPT-4. Use a different model for evaluation than for the agent itself to avoid bias. * **Maintain clarity in tool definitions** : use simple, descriptive tool names with lowercase alphanumeric characters and no spaces or special characters. Names must match what’s referenced in the prompt exactly. ## 3\. Treat every capability as a tool

* **Treat every external capability as a tool** : tools should have tight input/output contracts and clear success criteria. Reuse UiPath automations as tools whenever possible. * **Schema-driven prompts** : keep tool prompts concise and structured.
Validate output shapes and handle null or empty results explicitly. * **Document and version tools** : maintain clear versioning and evaluation history per tool. Link evaluation runs to specific versions. * **Build tools to increase reliability of the agent for deterministic tasks** : LLMs are not great at math, comparing dates, etc. In order to avoid any issues with the reliability of the agent, build tools that perform complex operations. ## 4\. Write prompts like product specs (not prose)

* **Iterative design and testing** : prompt engineering is an iterative craft, so use UiPath Agent Builder to refine your system prompts and task instructions by building proper evaluation sets and [testing](https://www.uipath.com/platform/agentic-testing) as you build.
* **Start with a system prompt that defines** :
  
    + Role and persona
    + Instructions
    + Goal and context
    + Success metrics
    + Guardrails and constraints
* **Use structured, multi-step reasoning** : incorporate chain-of-thought style reasoning for complex workflows. Explicitly define task decomposition, reasoning methods, and output formats. * **Be specific and as detailed as possible about the desired outcome** of your agent: make sure you define the proper output schema of your out arguments in UiPath Data Manager. Providing examples helps as well. * **Describe what should happen instead of what should** **_not_** **happen** : It's the difference between prompting your AI agent with “Do NOT ask for personal information” and “Avoid asking for personal information, instead refer the user to…”. * **Consider different prompts to accomplish the same task** : models have different implicit behavior.

# Examples of Prompts

The previous section introduced a basic example of how to prompt LLMs. This section will provide more examples of how to use prompts to achieve different tasks and introduce key concepts along the way. Often, the best way to learn concepts is by going through examples. The few examples below illustrate how you can use well-crafted prompts to perform different types of tasks.
 ... 
This will alert editors and reviewers to scrutinize manuscripts more carefully for potential biases, inaccuracies and improper source crediting. Likewise, scientific journals should be transparent about their use of LLMs, for example when selecting submitted manuscripts. Mention the large language model based product mentioned in the paragraph above:
```

_Output:_

```
The large language model based product mentioned in the paragraph above is ChatGPT. ```

There are many ways you can improve the results above, but this is already very useful. By now it should be obvious that you can ask the model to perform different tasks by simply instructing it what to do. That's a powerful capability that AI product developers are already using to build powerful products and experiences.
 ... 
They are created when a very massive star dies and its core collapses in on itself, forming a singularity of infinite density. The intense gravity of the singularity pulls in all the matter and radiation around it, creating the black hole. ```

Our AI research assistant sounds a bit too technical, right? Okay, let's change this behavior and instruct the system to give more accessible answers. _Prompt:_

```
The following is a conversation with an AI research assistant. The assistant answers should be easy to understand even by primary school students. Human: Hello, who are you? AI: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today? Human: Can you tell me about the creation of black holes? AI:
```

_Output:_

```
Sure! Black holes are created when a very massive star runs out of fuel and collapses in on itself. The gravity of the star is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull.
This creates a point in space-time with an intense gravitational force called a black hole. ```

You made some progress. You can continue improving it. If you add more examples, you might get even better results. * * *

## Code Generation []()

One application where LLMs are quite effective is code generation. Copilot is a great example of this. There are a vast number of code-generation tasks you can perform with clever prompts. Let's look at a few examples below. First, let's try a simple program that greets the user. _Prompt:_

```
/* Ask the user for their name and say "Hello" */
```

_Output:_

```
let name = prompt("What is your name? "); console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

Notice that you didn't even need to specify the language to use. Let's switch levels a bit. The example below shows how powerful LLMs can be with a little more effort in designing the prompts.
 ... 
If you provide better instructions combined with examples, it might help get more accurate results. In the upcoming section, we will cover even more advanced prompt engineering concepts and techniques for improving performance on all these and more difficult tasks. ## Notebook []()

If you want to practice with the prompts above using Python, we have prepared a notebook to test some of the prompts using the OpenAI models. [Getting Started with Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/main/notebooks/pe-lecture.ipynb)

* [Rivet](https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/) , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and
* [Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/) , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows. These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code.
