      "* \n*\n\n[](/en.html)\n\n[](/en.html)\n\nClose\n\n# IAM Best Practices for AI Agents\n\n## Know your agents\n\nOrganizations should establish **discovery, identification, and lifecycle management** for all AI agents interacting with their systems. Each agent should be provisioned as a **dedicated identity** tied to a verified human or organizational owner and **de-provisioned when no longer needed** . Understanding the different classes of agents based on interaction method, autonomy, and trust boundary is crucial for applying appropriate IAM strategies. Assigning **sponsors or custodians** to review and certify agent access helps maintain accountability and governance over time.\n\n## Detect agents\n\nIAM systems should be capable of identifying when a session or connection is driven by an AI agent. Detection should combine **behavioral and technical signals** , such as device telemetry and interaction patterns, to distinguish legitimate agents from human users or malicious automation. **Tagging sessions originating from AI agents** enables visibility and allows downstream services to apply policy-based controls.\n\n## Apply delegation, not impersonation\n\nWhen AI agents act on behalf of human users, it is crucial to apply **delegation mechanisms rather than allowing the agent to impersonate the user** . This aligns with the concept of **authenticated delegation** where a user securely grants limited permissions to an agent. User credentials should not be directly shared with the agent; instead, **issue delegated tokens with limited scopes** . This ensures that the agent acts within defined boundaries and maintains a clear chain of accountability back to the human principal, while also enabling visibility and monitoring into agents' interactions with systems.\n\n## Authenticate humans out-of-band\n\nWhen **AI agents act on behalf of users** , the IAM system should **prompt the human user for explicit authentication and authorization** using out-of-band methods (such as push notifications, QR codes, or other suitable flows). This ensures that human users are not required to provide credentials to the agent and that sensitive operations include real-time human oversight and verified consent.\n\n## Authorize agents\n\nAI agents should be authorized based on the **principle of least privilege** , meaning they should have access only to the specific actions and resources required to perform their delegated tasks. Applying **policy-based controls** with **short-lived tokens** or **time-bound scopes** can further reduce the risk of misuse or compromise. For high-risk operations, explicit approval from the human identity should be required through human-in-the-loop verification.\n\n## Verify humans\n\nFor **sensitive operations attempted by AI agents** , organizations should explicitly **verify human approval** (a.k.a human-in-the-loop). Depending on the use-case and sensitivity, consider using challenges that are more robust to being mimicked by AI (for example, identity proofing with a selfie match is more robust to AI compared to OTP over email). This provides a crucial checkpoint for ensuring that critical actions are reviewed and authorized by a human sponsor or end-user before execution. **Logging these verification checkpoints** is essential for audit purposes. The authenticated delegation framework supports this by making the human role in agent workflows explicit, allowing for verification of decisions and correction of errors.\n\n## Monitor agent activity\n\nOrganizations should implement robust **monitoring and auditing mechanisms to track AI agent activities** . This includes **logging agent actions, detecting anomalies** in their behavior or access patterns, and **tracking the tools and resources** each agent access to ensure **compliance and visibility across systems** . When suspicious or noncompliant behavior is detected, access should be automatically revoked, and affected agents reviewed to confirm remediation and maintain governance integrity.\n\nFor more information on identity for AI, including tutorials and reference documents, we invite you to explore our [Identity for AI Developer Portal](https://developer.pingidentity.com/identity-for-ai/) .\n\nStart Today\n\nContact Sales\n\n[sales@pingidentity.com](mailto:sales@pingidentity.com)\n\nSee how Ping can help you deliver secure employee, partner, and customer experiences in a rapidly evolving digital world.\n\nRequest a Free Demo\n\nRequest a FREE Demo\n"

      "[Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?pg=what_is_header)\n\n## Page topics\n\n* [What are AI Agents? ]()\n* [What are the key principles that define AI agents? ]()\n* [What are the benefits of using AI agents? ]()\n* [What are the key components of AI agent architecture? ]()\n* [How does an AI agent work? ]()\n* [What are the types of AI agents? ]()\n* [What are the challenges of using AI agents? ]()\n* [How can AWS help with your AI agent requirements? ]()\n\n## What are AI Agents? An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use that data to perform self-directed tasks that meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolve customer queries.\n ... \nAI agents can improve your business operations and your customers' experiences. ### Improved productivity\n\nBusiness teams are more productive when they delegate repetitive tasks to AI agents. This way, they can divert their attention to mission-critical or creative activities, adding more value to their organization. ### Reduced costs\n\nBusinesses can utilize intelligent agents to minimize unnecessary costs resulting from process inefficiencies, human errors, and manual processes. They can confidently tackle complex tasks because autonomous agents follow a consistent model that adapts to changing environments. Agent technology automating business processes can lead to significant cost savings. ### Informed decision-making\n\nAdvanced intelligent agents have predictive capabilities and can collect and process massive amounts of real-time data. This enables business managers to make more informed predictions at speed when strategizing their next move.\n ... \nThe LLM acts as the agent's reasoning engine, processing prompts and transforming them into actions, decisions, or queries to other components (e.g., memory or tools). It retains some memory across sessions by default and can be coupled with external systems to simulate continuity and context awareness. ### Planning module\n\nThe planning module enables the agent to break down goals into smaller, manageable steps and sequence them logically. This module employs symbolic reasoning, decision trees, or algorithmic strategies to determine the most effective approach for achieving a desired outcome. It can be implemented as a prompt-driven task decomposition or more formalized approaches, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) or classical planning algorithms. Planning allows the agent to operate over longer time horizons, considering dependencies and contingencies between tasks.\n### Memory module\n\nThe memory module allows the agent to retain information across interactions, sessions, or tasks. This includes both short-term memory, such as chat history or recent sensor input, and long-term memory, including customer data, prior actions, or accumulated knowledge. Memory enhances the agent’s personalization, coherence, and context-awareness. When building AI agents, developers use vector databases or knowledge graphs to store and retrieve semantically meaningful content. ### Tool integration\n\nAI agents often extend their capabilities by connecting to external software, APIs, or devices. This allows them to act beyond natural language, performing real-world tasks such as retrieving data, sending emails, running code, querying databases, or controlling hardware. The agent identifies when a task requires a tool and then delegates the operation accordingly.\n ... \nAI agents work by simplifying and automating complex tasks. Most autonomous agents follow a specific workflow when performing assigned tasks. ### Determine goals\n\nThe AI agent receives a specific instruction or goal from the user. It uses the goal to plan tasks that make the final outcome relevant and useful to the user. Then, the agent breaks down the goal into several smaller, actionable tasks. To achieve the goal, the agent performs those tasks based on specific orders or conditions. ### Acquire information\n\nAI agents require information to execute tasks they have planned successfully. For example, the agent must extract conversation logs to analyze customer sentiments. As such, AI agents might access the internet to search for and retrieve the information they need. In some applications, an intelligent agent can interact with other agents or machine learning models to access or exchange information."

This is the prompt structure real AI AGENT need to survive in production\n\nWhen we talk about prompting engineer in agentic ai environments, things change a lot compared to just using chatgpt or any other chatbot(generative ai). and yeah, i’m also including cursor ai here, the code editor with built-in ai chat, because it’s still a conversation loop where you fix things, get suggestions, and eventually land on what you need. there’s always a human in the loop. that’s the main difference between prompting in generative ai and prompting in agent-based workflows\n\nwhen you’re inside a workflow, whether it’s an automation or an ai agent, everything changes. you don’t get second chances. unless the agent is built to learn from its own mistakes, which most aren’t, you really only have one shot. you have to define the output format.\nyou need to be careful with tokens. and that’s why writing prompts for these kinds of setups becomes a whole different game\n\ni’ve been in the industry for over 8 years and have been teaching courses for a while now. one of them is focused on ai agents and how to get started building useful flows. in those classes, i share a prompt template i’ve been using for a long time and i wanted to share it here to see if others are using something similar or if there’s room to improve it\n\nTemplate:\n\n```\n## Role (required)\nYou are a [brief role description]\n\n## Task(s) (required)\nYour main task(s) are:\n1. Identify if the lead is qualified based on message content\n2. Assign a priority: high, medium, low\n3. Return the result in a structured format\nIf you are an agent, use the available tools to complete each step when needed.\n## Response format (required)\nPlease reply using the following JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"qualified\": true,\n  \"priority\": \"high\",\n  \"reason\": \"Lead mentioned immediate interest and provided company details\"\n}\n```\n```\n\nThe template has a few parts, but the ones i always consider required are  \n**role** , to define who the agent is inside the workflow  \n**task** , to clearly list what it’s supposed to do  \n**expected output** , to explain what kind of response you want\n\nthen there are a few optional ones:  \n**tools** , only if the agent is using specific tools  \n**context** , in case there’s some environment info the model needs  \n**rules** , like what’s forbidden, expected tone, how to handle errors  \n**input output examples** if you want to show structure or reinforce formatting\n\ni usually write this in markdown. it works great for GPT's models. for anthropic’s claude, i use html tags instead of markdown because it parses those more reliably.\n ... \nRead more Share\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nRelated Answers\n\n[Best practices for AI agent prompt structures](/answers/88a99ff8-a7ff-47f6-b77e-b1033b2c0304/?q=Best%20practices%20for%20AI%20agent%20prompt%20structures&source=PDP)\n\n[Examples of meaningful AI prompts](/answers/bff522ed-8d50-4727-9353-d94434c904a9/?q=Examples%20of%20meaningful%20AI%20prompts&source=PDP)\n\n[Innovative uses of AI agents in daily life](/answers/445fef80-cf84-4e80-86a7-59de39902e55/?q=Innovative%20uses%20of%20AI%20agents%20in%20daily%20life&source=PDP)\n\n[Best AI tools for productivity enhancement](/answers/22205445-4a8b-4f1b-aaaa-33503c72ae71/?q=Best%20AI%20tools%20for%20productivity%20enhancement&source=PDP)\n\n[Future trends in AI agent technology](/answers/4aad800d-722a-4449-9e28-4edf69569c0c/?q=Future%20trends%20in%20AI%20agent%20technology&source=PDP)\n\nNew to Reddit?

      "<sup>8</sup> There are many no-code templates for user implementation, making the process of creating these AI agents even easier. Healthcare AI agents can be used for various real-world healthcare applications. [Multi-agent systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system) can be particularly useful for problem-solving in such settings. From treatment planning for patients in the emergency department to managing drug processes, these systems save the time and effort of medical professionals for more urgent tasks. <sup>9</sup>\n\nEmergency response In case of natural disasters, AI agents can use [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning) algorithms to retrieve the information of users on social media sites that need rescue. The locations of these users can be mapped to assist rescue services in saving more people in less time. Therefore, AI agents can greatly benefit human life in both mundane, repetitive tasks and life-saving situations."
