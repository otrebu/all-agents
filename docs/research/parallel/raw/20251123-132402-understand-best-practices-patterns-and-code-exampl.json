The key difference is that process.cwd() returns the current working directory from which the Node.js process was started, while \\_\\_dirname returns the directory name of the current module (the file in which the code is running). This means that process.cwd() can change based on where the process is run, whereas \\_\\_dirname is constant and points to the location of the script file.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the differences between process.cwd() and \\_\\_dirname in more detail. ## What is process.cwd()? process.cwd() stands for \"current working directory\". It returns the directory from which the [Node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/nodejs/) process was started. In other words, process.cwd() gives you the directory where the Node.js command was executed, regardless of where the script is located. ****Syntax:****\n  \n  ```\n  process.cwd();\n  ```\n  \n  ## What is \\_\\_dirname? \\_\\_dirname is a built-in variable in Node.js that gives the absolute path of the directory containing the current JavaScript file (the file in which \\_\\_dirname is used). Unlike process.cwd(), which is dependent on where the process is started, \\_\\_dirname always points to the directory of the script file. ****Now Let's see a few examples demonstrating both these. ****\n  \n  ****Example 1:****\n  \n  index.js ```````\n  // Logging process.cwd() output \n   console .\nlog ( \"process.cwd(): \" , process . cwd ()); \n  \n   // Logging __dirname output \n   console . log ( \"__dirname: \" , __dirname );\n  ```````\n  \n  ****Output:****\n  \n  ```\n  process.cwd(): C:\\src  \n  __dirname: C:\\src\n  ```\n  \n  In this case node process is running in the current directory\n  \n  ****Example 2:**** Create the following 2 files with the following folder structure:\n  \n  ```\n  src/  \n  ___ index.js  \n  ___ src2/  \n      ___index2.js\n  ```\n  \n  ****FilePath: src/index.js****\n  \n  index.js ```````\n  // Read and execute the index2.js file \n   require ( './sub1/index2.js' )\n  ```````\n  \n  ****FilePath: src/src2/index2.js****\n  \n  index2.js ```````\n  // Logging process.cwd() output \n   console . log ( \"process.cwd(): \" , process . cwd ()); \n  \n   // Logging __dirname output \n   console .\nlog ( \"__dirname: \" , __dirname );\n  ```````\n  \n  ****Output:****\n  \n  ```\n  process cwd:  C:\\src  \n  __dirname:  C:\\src\\src2\n  ```\n  \n  This shows that the current node process was running in __src/__ folder i.e node __index.js__ and the directory of the file __index2.js__ was at __src/src2__ . ## Difference Between process.cwd() and \\_\\_dirname\n  \n  |****Feature**** |****process.cwd()**** |****\\_\\_dirname**** |\n  | --- | --- | --- |\n  |****Definition**** |Returns the ****current working directory**** where the Node.js process was started. |Returns the ****directory name**** of the current module (file). |\n  |****Changes with Directory**** |Can change based on where you execute the Node.js script. |Always refers to the location of the script file, remains constant. |\n  |****Use Case**** |Useful for determining where the process is running (e.g., loading configuration files). |Useful for resolving relative paths within a specific module.\n|\n  |****Scope**** |A global value tied to the Node.js process. |Tied to the script/module, cannot be changed. |\n  \n  \n  ## Conclusion\n  \n  Both process.cwd() and \\_\\_dirname are essential tools in Node.js, but they serve different purposes:\n  \n    + process.cwd() is useful for determining the current working directory, which can change depending on where the Node.js process is started. + \\_\\_dirname always refers to the directory where the current script is located, making it the go-to choice for resolving relative paths within your modules."

I would like to see what is the best way to determine the current script directory in Python.\nI discovered that, due to the many ways of calling Python code, it is hard to find a good solution. Here are some problems:\n\n* `__file__` is not defined if the script is executed with `exec` , `execfile`\n* `__module__` is defined only in modules\n\nUse cases:\n\n* `./myfile.py`\n* `python myfile.py`\n* `./somedir/myfile.py`\n* `python somedir/myfile.py`\n* `execfile('myfile.py')` (from another script, that can be located in another directory and that can have another current directory. I know that there is no perfect solution, but I'm looking for the best approach that solves most of the cases. The most used approach is `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` but this really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with `exec()` . ## Warning\n\nAny solution that uses current directory will fail, this can be different based on the way the script is called or it can be changed inside the running script.\n* [python](/questions/tagged/python \"show questions tagged 'python'\")\n* [path](/questions/tagged/path \"show questions tagged 'path'\")\n* [working-directory](/questions/tagged/working-directory \"show questions tagged 'working-directory'\")\n\n[Share](/q/3718657 \"Short permalink to this question\")\n\n[Improve this question](/posts/3718657/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Sep 4, 2022 at 1:29](/posts/3718657/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\n[](/users/523612/karl-knechtel)\n\n[Karl Knechtel](/users/523612/karl-knechtel)\n\n61\\.3k 14 14 gold badges 131 131 silver badges 193 193 bronze badges\n\nasked Sep 15, 2010 at 14:34\n\n[](/users/192632/bogdan)\n\n[bogdan](/users/192632/bogdan) bogdan\n\n9,474 10 10 gold badges 41 41 silver badges 42 42 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n* 1\n  \n  Can you be more specific where you need to know where the file comes from? - in the code thats importing the file (include-aware host) or in the file thats imported?\n(self-aware slave)\n  \n  synthesizerpatel\n  \n  – [synthesizerpatel](/users/210613/synthesizerpatel \"28,256 reputation\")\n  \n  2011-06-01 21:19:40 +00:00\n  \n  Commented Jun 1, 2011 at 21:19\n* 6\n  \n  See Ron Kalian's `pathlib` solution if you're using python 3.4 or higher: [stackoverflow.com/a/48931294/1011724](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48931294/1011724)\n  \n  Dan\n  \n  – [Dan](/users/1011724/dan \"45,822 reputation\")\n  \n  2018-08-22 11:46:09 +00:00\n  \n  Commented Aug 22, 2018 at 11:46\n* So the solution is NOT to use any current directory in code, but to use some config file?

Yes, for normal use cases locate works separately from the current working directory and is therefore unaffected by things like `os.chdir` . No, when used from an interactive Python session!

The `get_dir` function, which will return the directory of the current script (or `os.getcwd()` when used interactively). 2. `prepend_sys_path` (or `append_sys_path` ), which will evaluate all paths relative to `get_dir` and then add it to `sys.path` (more importantly, it allows for temporary effect: `with prepend_sys_path(\"../foopath\"): import foo` )\n\n1 Reply\n\n* Copy link\n\n8\n\n[](/posts/3718912/timeline \"Show activity on this post.\") Would\n\n```\nimport os\ncwd = os.getcwd()\n```\n\ndo what you want?

      "However it is not the only directory of interest of course it is also important to know how to go about getting the directory of the current script, and also how to get paths to assets that are relative to that script. There is also how to go about getting the user folder location when it comes to a standard location to park user specific data. So in this post I will be covering a basic example of the [process.cwd](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html) method of course, but I will also be touching base on a whole bunch of other little topics that revolve around that. ## []( \"1 - Just a basic process.cwd example for now when it just comes to getting the Current Working Directory\") 1 - Just a basic process.cwd example for now when it just comes to getting the Current Working Directory\n\nIf I just want to get the current working directory I can use the process.cwd method to do so.\n ... \n## []( \"2 - Getting gin the path to the current script\") 2 - Getting gin the path to the current script\n\nThe process.cwd method will get the current working directory, but [process.cwd should not be confused with dirname](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9874382/whats-the-difference-between-process-cwd-vs-dirname) . When process.cwd will return the current working directory, the \\_\\_dirname global will return the directory that contains the current javaScript source code file. When first starting out with simple scripts often a new developer will keep calling node in the same root path as the script, and in that case the two options will of course return the same result. However if you take a moment to make your script a project that can be installed globally, of if you just call your script from another folder the values will of course differ.\n ... \n## []( \"4 - Using the path module\") 4 - Using the path module\n\nI often will want to create new paths that are relative to the current working directory, or the directory in which the current source code script is located. Say for example I want to get a script that should be located in a lib folder relative to the location of the current script. To get that path I will need to combine the value of \\_\\_dirname with a string value that is the rest of the path that will resolve to an absolute path to that script that I want. For these kinds of tasks there is the path module, and for something to this effect there is the path.resolve method to be specific about it."

      "# Difference between process.cwd & \\_ \\_dirname in NodeJS\n\n[Node.js](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/articles/category/Node-js) [Server Side Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/articles/category/Server-Side-Programming) [Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/articles/category/Programming)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nNodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that was built on top of Chrome's V8 engine. The traditional use of JavaScript is to be executed in browsers, but with Node.JS we can execute JavaScript other than browsers like servers, hardware devices, etc. ## process.cwd()\n\nThe process object lies under the global object known as 'global'. This method provides information about the current process of Node.js. It also provides control over the same. cwd refers to the current working directory of the same. Therefore, **process.cwd** returns the working directory on which execution is taking place currently.\n## \\_\\_dirname\n\nThis is a local module that will return the directory name of the current module. Also, it is a local module\n\n|process.cwd |\\_\\_dirname |\n| --- | --- |\n|Returns name of the current working directory. |Returns the name of the directory containing the source code files. |\n|It is a global object inside Node. |It is a local object |\n|It depends on the command which is invoked. |It depends upon the current directory.\n|\n\n\n## process.cwd() vs \\_\\_dirname\n\n### Example 1 (index.js)\n\n```\n// Logging process.cwd() output\nconsole.log(\"process.cwd(): \", process.cwd());\n\n// Logging __dirname output\nconsole.log(\"__dirname: \", __dirname);\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\tutorialsPoint\\> node index.js.js\nprocess.cwd(): /home/node/demo\n__dirname: /home/node/demo\n```\n\n### Example 2\n\nCreate the following files with the below folder structure\n\n```\n-- src/\n   --index.js\n   --src2/\n      --index2.js\n```\n\n**Code Snippet (index.js)** −\n\n```\n// Read and execute the index2.js file\nrequire('./sub1/index2.js')\n```\n\n**Code Snippet (index2.js)** −\n\n```\n// Logging process.cwd() output\nconsole.log(\"process.cwd(): \", process.cwd());\n\n// Logging __dirname output\nconsole.log(\"__dirname: \", __dirname);\n```\n\nRun the index2.js file using the following command.\n```\n   node index2.js\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nprocess cwd: C:\\src\n__dirname: C:\\src\\src2\n```\n\nThe above output shows that the directory of the file index2.js is at src/src2 whereas the current node process is running in src/ folder."

      "Let's look at how to access the current working directory using the `os` and `pathlib` modules and compare the two solutions. ### Using `os.getcwd()` The `os` module allows access to the computer's operating system. The `getcwd()` function fetches the current working directory: ```\nimport os\ncwd = os.getcwd()\nprint(cwd)\n``` ```\n/Users/sg/Documents/GitHub/datacamp\n``` The output shows the path of the directory containing the script. The path's format depends on the operating system. The above output is for POSIX operating systems such as Linux, Unix, and macOS. The same path on a Windows system would display as follows: ```\nC:\\Users\\sg\\Documents\\GitHub\\datacamp\n``` The value returned by `os.getcwd()` is a [string](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-string-tutorial) : ```\nprint(type(cwd))\n``` ```\n<class 'str'>\n``` Therefore, we need to use string methods and other string operations to deal with this path.\n ... \n## Changing the Current Working Directory (CWD) It's also possible to change the current working directory directly from within a Python program using `os.chdir()` . Since this is not an operation that's directly related to the path, there's no alternative version in `pathlib` . However, we can still use `pathlib.Path` objects as arguments: ```\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\ncwd = Path.cwd()\nprint(cwd)\n\nos.chdir(cwd.parent)\ncwd = Path.cwd()\nprint(cwd)\n``` ```\n/Users/sg/Documents/GitHub/datacamp\n/Users/sg/Documents/GitHub\n``` The working directory has now changed. We can also use `cwd.parent.resolve()` to ensure any symbolic links are dealt with correctly. The argument in `os.chdir()` can also be a string, such as the paths returned by functions in the `os` module. Caution is needed when changing the working directory within a program to ensure there aren't any unexpected behaviors."
