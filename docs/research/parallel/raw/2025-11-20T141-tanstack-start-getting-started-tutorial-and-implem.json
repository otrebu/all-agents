[## TypeScript Configuration]()\n\nWe highly recommend using TypeScript with TanStack Start.\nCreate a tsconfig.json file with at least the following settings:\n\njson\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Bundler\",\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Bundler\",\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote\n\n> Enabling verbatimModuleSyntax can result in server bundles leaking into client bundles. It is recommended to keep this option disabled. [## Install Dependencies]()\n\nTanStack Start is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and requires them as dependencies.\nTo install them, run:\n\nshell\n\n```\nnpm i @tanstack/react-start @tanstack/react-router\n```\n\n```\nnpm i @tanstack/react-start @tanstack/react-router\n```\n\nWe also need vite as a devDependency:\n\nshell\n\n```\nnpm i -D vite\n```\n\n```\nnpm i -D vite\n```\n\nYou'll also need React:\n\nshell\n\n```\nnpm i react react-dom\n```\n\n```\nnpm i react react-dom\n```\n\nAs well as React's Vite plugin:\n\nshell\n\n```\nnpm i -D @vitejs/plugin-react\n```\n\n```\nnpm i -D @vitejs/plugin-react\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use @vitejs/plugin-react-oxc or @vitejs/plugin-react-swc .\n ... \n<HeadContent />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Scripts />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n[## Writing Your First Route]()\n\nNow that we have the basic templating setup, we can write our first route. This is done by creating a new file in the src/routes directory.\n ... \n</button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\n// src/routes/index.tsx\nimport * as fs from 'node:fs'\nimport { createFileRoute, useRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'\n\nconst filePath = 'count.txt'\n\nasync function readCount() {\n  return parseInt(\n    await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8').catch(() => '0'),\n  )\n}\n\nconst getCount = createServerFn({\n  method: 'GET',\n}).handler(() => {\n  return readCount()\n})\n\nconst updateCount = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })\n  .inputValidator((d: number) => d)\n  .handler(async ({ data }) => {\n    const count = await readCount()\n    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`)\n  })\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Home,\n  loader: async () => await getCount(),\n})\n\nfunction\nHome() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const state = Route.useLoaderData()\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => {\n        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {\n          router.invalidate()\n        })\n      }}\n    >\n      Add 1 to {state}? </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! 🤯 You've now set up a TanStack Start project and written your first route. 🎉\n\nYou can now run npm run dev to start your server and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your route in action.

He minds RSC is just an api but returning JSX, not JSON. It will be then so easy to think the architectural mental model for thinking creating SPA and querying RSC if we need server power. Still be small community to find resources, but will be great DX especially it has 100 type safety router.\nOn the other hand, Nextjs is server first router that even runs client component server first and then client. Still I don’t like Client component can’t import server component, RSC response is big that cause re-rending the whole RSC page even though very small portion is changed, but it has a huuuge comunity that so easy to find starting template and we can even create it with V0. Still they might try to vendor lock to host Next app to Vercel if we want to use Partial Pre-rendering though.\nSo what is your thought if you are going to start new project? It may depends on what project you are going to, but in generously. I would choose Tanstack Start because it will be so easy to architect application that think of SPA and query to get RSC if need it. It also supports static pre-rending, so just make some landing page static as well. No need Next’s SSG. I may want Next’s partial pre-rending, but needs to compare with Vercel hosting cost.\nRead more\nShare\nShare\nRelated Answers Section\nRelated Answers\nComparison of Tanstack Start and Next.js\nDifferences between Next.js and React\nReact Query vs Tanstack Query\nBest practices for using React Query with RSC\nTanstack Start features and server functions\nNew to Reddit?\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy .\nPublic\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\nReddit Rules Privacy Policy User Agreement Accessibility Reddit, Inc. © 2025.

      "Last updated: 20250318\nkg. kg. [Home](/) [About](/about) [Essays](/essays) [Projects](/projects) [Contact](/contact)\n\n# Next.js vs TanStack\n\nKyle Gill, Software Engineer, Particl\n\nLast updated\n\n> See [this post](https://jaredpalmer.com/blog/gatsby-vs-nextjs) for inspiration. > \n> \n\nOver the past few months, I’ve moved as much code as possible away from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) . While I see why people are attracted to it and its growing ecosystem, I am no longer sipping the KoolAid. [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/) , while not perfect either, provides better abstractions that are more than adequate for the vast majority of projects. In this post, I am going to share my personal opinions about the two projects as they relate to making web applications. ## []() What is Next.js good at?\nBefore I discuss its shortcomings, I want to share where I think Next.js excels by sharing my recent experience with it. At [Particl](https://particl.com) , we took a bet on where the ecosystem was moving for our web properties. Vercel had hired up many of the React core team ( [around 25% of it](https://react.dev/community/team) ), and was hiring open source maintainers aggressively. It looked like Next.js would see continuing support and would feature the most integrations with the latest packages. For that reason, we chose Next.js to build our web app, as well as our website (when we moved off of Webflow).\n### []() Everything OOTB\n\nGetting set up was not difficult, adding support for most package was a breeze, and there were integration guides for everything from [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/nextjs/) , to [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs) , as well as more enterprise stuff like [DataDog real-user monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/monitor-your-nextjs-app-with-rum/?tab=npm) . The speed with which you can get setup out of the box is great, and other ancillary tools often just work™️ with it. If you want Jest, someone from the Next.js team has already merged [a native plugin](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1) that gets things configured semi-magically.\nThe marketing lingo labels Next.js “The React Framework for the Web”, and it’s definitely one of the easiest ways to get a React app up and running out there. ### []() High-scale optimization\n\nNext.js is also great at the **really high scale** use cases, with the ability to surgically tweak the rendering pattern of individual pages across your app. You don’t have to inflate your build times to render millions of pages, you can render them on demand with server-side rendering (SSR). Authenticated routes can stay client-side (CSR) if you want. You can shave off milliseconds with advanced APIs like partial pre-rendering (PPR), edge functions, and caching. Other packages like streaming and selective hydration can make your app feel snappier and precisely isolate performance bottlenecks.\n ... \n### []() Scale\n\nFor some use cases, I can see the justification for micro-performance improvements. For small to mid-sized startups I really don’t need much more than a server and a client. I’m okay with a couple hundred extra milliseconds while we find product-market fit. _But the users! How dare you!_\n\nOur customers buy our software because it solves their problem. Our customers want their problem solved in seconds, instead of days or weeks. At our size, saving an extra 100ms is a premature optimization. ### []() Financial incentives\n\nBecause [incentives rule everything around me](https://perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous/) , I understand the marketing dollars get poured into selling cloud software.\n ... \nTurbopack itself favors the app directory, and lacks implementation of some optimizations for the pages directory. I imagine they’ll get there someday, but when you have 2 codebases to maintain, it makes sense that one has to be the 2nd priority. ## []() TanStack + Vite is simple and elegant\n\nYou really don’t need to much. You can deploy anywhere, get code that compiles fast, and is a delight to work with. TanStack Router gives me auto-complete on any page in my app, **including search params that are validated by Zod** .\n ... \n```\nconst { isPending, error, data } = useQuery({\n\nqueryKey: ['repoData'],\n\nqueryFn: () =>\n\nfetch('https://api.github.com/repos/TanStack/query').then((res) =>\n\nres.json(),\n\n),\n\n})\n```\n\nEach of these have their own built-in dev tools (imagine that)! When I need them, more advanced APIs are available and they always feel like an extension of the current API, on one of these plain functions. TanStack doesn’t make money when I deploy with its APIs, and I feel like I can grok the entire API surface. Then there’s Vite, it’s fast, gets out of the way, and just works. It’s most of the good parts of Next.js, without the baggage. There is a growing ecosystem and no company selling it as a cloud service (yet)."

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on this process, refer to the [introduction to the TanStack Start framework](https://blog.logrocket.com/tanstack-start-overview/) article. * * *\n\n* * *\n\n## Should you choose TanStack Start or Next JS?"
