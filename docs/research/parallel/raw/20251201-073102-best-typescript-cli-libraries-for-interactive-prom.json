I’m Alex, a Senior Software Engineer with a passion for TypeScript and open-source tools.\nToday, I’ll guide you through building a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool using TypeScript, a project that will showcase your skills and boost your productivity. Whether you’re a seasoned TypeScript developer or just starting, this tutorial will take you from zero to hero in CLI development. ### Introduction\n\nCLI tools are an essential part of a developer’s toolkit, providing a way to automate tasks, interact with applications, and perform system-level operations. Building a CLI tool is an excellent way to enhance your TypeScript skills and create a useful utility for yourself and others. In this tutorial, we’ll create a CLI tool that interacts with a GitHub API, allowing users to fetch and manage their repositories right from the command line. ### Prerequisites\n\nBefore we dive in, make sure you have the following set up:\n\n* A solid understanding of TypeScript or JavaScript. If you’re new to TypeScript, consider checking out some introductory resources first.\n ... \n### Loading Commands ( `src/commands/github.ts` )\n\nCreate the `src/commands/github.ts` file with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Command } from 'commander';  \nexport function loadCommands(program: Command) {  \nprogram  \n.command('github')  \n.description('Interact with the GitHub API')  \n.action(() => {  \nconsole.log('GitHub command loaded');  \n});  \n}\n```\n\nThis module defines a `loadCommands` function that adds a new command to our CLI tool. When the `github` command is executed, it will print a message to the console. ### Testing the CLI\n\nCompile your TypeScript code by running:\n\n```\nnpx tsc\n```\n\nThis will create a `dist` directory with the compiled JavaScript files. Execute your CLI tool:\n\n```\nnode dist/index.js github\n```\n\nYou should see the message “GitHub command loaded” in the console. ### Step 3: Adding Functionality\n\nNow, let’s add some real functionality to our `github` command. We'll use the `octokit` library to interact with the GitHub API.\n ... \n### Testing Error Handling and Validation\n\nCompile and run your CLI tool with invalid input:\n\n```\nnode dist/index.js github list-repos invalid-sort\n```\n\nYou should see an error message indicating the issue. ### Step 6: Best Practices and Pro Tips\n\n* **Use TypeScript Interfaces** : Define interfaces for your command options and arguments to improve type safety and documentation. * **Modularize Your Code** : Break down complex commands into smaller functions or modules for better maintainability. * **Unit Testing** : Write unit tests for your command modules to ensure they work as expected. * **User Feedback** : Provide clear and informative feedback to users, especially when handling errors or validating input. * **Command Aliases** : Consider adding command aliases for convenience, e.g., `list` as an alias for `list-repos` . ### Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Missing Dependencies** : Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.\n ... \n* **Interactive Mode** : Explore libraries like `inquirer` to add interactive prompts to your CLI. * **Continuous Integration** : Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment. Happy coding, and keep building awesome tools with TypeScript!"

It’s like having a swiss army knife for parsing input, help text, and managing errors. ```\nnpm install commander\n```\n\n### Step 3: Crafting The CLI\n\nCreate a file named **index.js** in your project folder.\n ... \nYou can read about it [here](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html) and decide if you want to use it instead of commander.js. ## User Experience\n\n### Add Some Color\n\n[Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) is perfect for making your CLI’s output pop with color. Grab it with:\n\n```\nnpm install chalk\n```\n\nNow, let’s improve our greeting:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env node  \n  \nimport { program } from \"commander\";  \nimport chalk from \"chalk\";  \n  \nprogram  \n  .version(\"1.0.0\")  \n  .description(\"My Node CLI\")  \n  .option(\"-n, --name <type>\", \"Add your name\")  \n  .action((options) => {  \n    console.log(chalk.blue(`Hey, ${options.name}!`));  \n    console.log(chalk.green(`Hey, ${options.name}!`));  \n    console.log(chalk.red(`Hey, ${options.name}!`));  \n  });  \n  \nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n```\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n### Prompting Made Easy\n\nFor a more interactive vibe, [**Inquirer.js**](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) is your friend.\n```\nnpm install inquirer\n```\n\nInstead of using command line options to collect data — just ask the user\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env node  \n  \nimport { program } from \"commander\";  \nimport chalk from \"chalk\";  \nimport inquirer from \"inquirer\";  \n  \nprogram.version(\"1.0.0\").description(\"My Node CLI\");  \n  \nprogram.action(() => {  \n  inquirer  \n    .prompt([  \n      {  \n        type: \"input\",  \n        name: \"name\",  \n        message: \"What's your name? \",  \n      },  \n    ])  \n    .then((answers) => {  \n      console.log(chalk.green(`Hey there, ${answers.name}!`));  \n    });  \n});  \n  \nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n```\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThere is a **Confirm** prompt type **—** Asks the user a yes/no question. Press enter or click to view image in full size\n\n**List** prompt type — Allows the user to choose from a list of options. Press enter or click to view image in full size\n\nAnd there are also **Checkbox, Password** , **Rawlist** and **Expand** .\n ... \n## Contributing  \nContributions are welcome ...  \n  \n## License  \nThis project is licensed ...\n```\n\n### Auto Generating Documentation\n\nConsider using tools like [**JSDoc**](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) or [**TypeDoc**](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) , they can generate detailed documentation from your code comments. ```\n/**  \n * This function greets the user by name. * @param {string} name The name of the user. */  \nconst greet = (name) => {  \n  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);  \n};\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nBefore you start working on the actual CLI logic I would strongly recommend checking this [repo by Liran Tal](https://github.com/lirantal/nodejs-cli-apps-best-practices) , it has more than 3k stars and covers all the best practices I could think of and more."

      "`default` vs. `initial` , or `title` vs. `name` ) and sometimes behave differently in unexpected ways. For instance, when a user presses the CTRL+C sequence, `inquirer` immediately kills the process, `enquirer` throws an error, and `prompts` cancels the prompt but continues execution without error. Additionally, all three have some demonstrably wrong types that make development with TypeScript difficult. The `inquirer` package is the oldest of the three and has the largest market-share by downloads and number of dependent packages. It is strengthened by its ability to register custom prompt types via other 3rd party packages such as `inquirer-autocomplete-prompt` , `inquirer-directory` , and `inquirer-checkbox-plus-prompt` . It is still under active development by its author and has been undergoing [a full refactor](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/issues/692) since 2018."
