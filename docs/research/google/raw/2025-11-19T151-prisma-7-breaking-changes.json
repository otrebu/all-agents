  ],
  "summary": "Prisma 7 is a significant upcoming release focused on improving performance, developer experience, and configuration management. The key breaking changes include the mandatory adoption of a `prisma.config.ts` file, a 'Rust-free' ORM by default, and a new `prisma-client` generator that requires an explicit output path. Additionally, automatic loading of `.env` files will be removed in favor of configuration within `prisma.config.ts`. While Prisma 7 is not yet released, many of these features are being introduced in earlier versions as opt-in previews to allow for a smoother transition. The changes are expected to result in a smaller bundle size, faster query performance, and a more streamlined development workflow."
