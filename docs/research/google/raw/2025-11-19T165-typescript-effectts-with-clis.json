    "Key features of `@effect/cli` include automatic generation of help documentation, shell completion scripts, and a unique 'Wizard Mode' for interactive prompts.",
    "CLIs built with `@effect/cli` are structured around `Command` objects, which can be nested to create subcommands. Commands can have options and arguments.",
    "Integration with the Node.js environment is handled by `@effect/platform-node`, which provides access to Node-specific APIs.",
    "The `create-effect-app` tool can be used to bootstrap a new Effect project, including a pre-configured CLI template.",
    "For logging, `effect-ts` provides the `Effect.log` function and a `Console` module that integrates with the Effect system. Loggers are customizable with different formatters (e.g., `stringLogger`, `prettyLogger`, `jsonLogger`) and log levels.",
    "TypeScript CLI files can be executed directly using `npx tsx`, which compiles them on-the-fly."
